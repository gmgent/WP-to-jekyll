## Jekyll Base ##

this is an attempt at a one-stop Wordpress-to-Jekyll build. It is not ready just yet but please click around to take a look. It is almost ready.

The test.rb script is used to import the wordpress export file. the /blog subdirectory would be where the domain root gets mapped to. The conversion script should in theory work for any WP export, I made my export file from WP 3.4.2 - Tools, Export, Posts only, and I don't use tags, just categories. If you need tag support you will have to be ready to do some hacking. Categories will work right out of the box.
