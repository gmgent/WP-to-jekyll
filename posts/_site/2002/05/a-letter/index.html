<p>The art within myself
Not myself within the art
Good advice
When all there is to this game:
Passion and reason
North and south.
You speak so fluidly
Every word like saltwater
rising from the break
The air bristling with it.
And I am enclosed within this
Letter, just a notion of sweet
release, a blessing for you.
Tomorrow looms large
Like a glass tower and I will climb
Those fragile steps without care.
Looking out across rooftops
And clouds of bitter chalk
Drop my senses and watch them
Fall (as if from the heavens).
The essence of my path
Has been chaos, and I would very grimly
Speak of discipline
And sacrifice were it not
for the burden of truth.
If there has ever been
A home for my heartspeak
It is this symbol of infinity
That I cannot see.</p>

<p>Carry me, for one day
Beautiful chaos
Color the sky with a whim
Anywhere there is motion
Is a good place to begin</p>
