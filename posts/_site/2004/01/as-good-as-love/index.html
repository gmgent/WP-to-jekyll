<p>Again, time is quiet
Motionless. I watch young winter
Clutter the seasons
Cold footsteps
Across this checkered floor
It is not enough to bleed
As it once was
Life is no longer priceless
And the wave of dull destiny
Will be taller than the sky
When it comes.</p>

<p>I have cold stones in my heart
And the color of desire
Is dark against the night
As the lights in Hollywood flicker
Eyes opened and shut
This is the fuel of the city
Burning innocence.
As if tomorrow
Was not paid for with the
Red faces of children
I have dragged my net
Across the deep</p>

<p>As good as love
As I swallow fire
Pray for me
That I may sleep</p>
