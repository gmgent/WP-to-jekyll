<p>Maybe I get a little too excited about buying urls. It's possible that is it is not normal. In any case, I was able to purchase<strong> axel.me</strong> for a very reasonable sum, and I am very happy about it. I think about once we have children, little Axels as it were, that I can set up a subdomain for everyone... A happy little family of bloggers, maybe.</p>

<p>Also, one day my wife may thank me for making <strong>lavinia.axel.me</strong> available for her if she wants to use it for something.</p>

<p>I even think about setting up my own short link service. Why not?</p>

<p>Am I crazy?</p>
