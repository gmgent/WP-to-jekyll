<p>In the last 7 days, <strong>theaxelvault.com</strong> has been down for almost 4 hours.</p>

<p>I was paying for a 'private' server. There is just no excuse for that. Thankfully I am almost done moving all of my sites and all of my data onto more reliable servers. I am now using <strong>Rackspace</strong>, <strong>Heroku</strong>, and <strong>Namecheap</strong> for my DNS and hosting needs, and <strong>theaxelvault.com</strong> soon <a href="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/2011/03/the-end-of-theaxelvault-com/">will be no more</a>.</p>

<p>See you later Dreamhost! Maybe one day you will get your act together.</p>
