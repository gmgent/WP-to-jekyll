<p>A dog barks at the morning prayer<br />
and the sky remembers everything</p>


<p>the smoke-filled houses<br />
leaned against each other<br />
the wild green hand of nature<br />
clutching at humanity. Go ahead<br />
and die, says the world<br />
we will not find you<br />
in your toothpick temples<br />
eating rice and leaves. Your children<br />
are not lucky enough to feel<br />
the breath of medicine.<br />
There is no love to spare.</p>
