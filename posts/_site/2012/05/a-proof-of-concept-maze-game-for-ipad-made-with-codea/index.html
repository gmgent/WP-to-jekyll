<p>I've been playing with <strong>Codea</strong>, a Lua-based iPad app that allows you to make your own iPad games. My game currently takes about 8 seconds to win, which is not much, but really I'm just messing around with things until I get the hang of it. I like Codea because Lua is a really simple scripting language with decidedly few curly brackets - thumbs up for that - and it ships with a bunch of sprites you can use. It's also pretty easy to get the Lua files off your iPad (using iExplore) for backup, and you can add your own png sprites by just putting them in a directory with a pinfo file and uploading them to your iPad. Sweet!</p>
