<p>Sweet Thing</p>

<p>I was the revolution
you were the liberation
that falls from a pregnant sky
set loose on a Friday night
I know what you do to me
you give love in these little pieces
saving for a rainy day
I think you should give it away</p>

<p>Sweet thing, sweet thing
all you get is nothing
sweet thing, sweet thing
all you get is nothing when you put nothing in</p>

<p>she's high on the running away
here tonight and gone the next day
sweet like a candy girl
lasts as long as a dirty word
soft like a butterfly
hot like a brushfire
don't make me fall in love
if you don't want to be the one</p>

<p>Sweet thing, sweet thing
all you get is nothing</p>

<p>Yeah, yeah and you're feeling so much better
you're feeling so much better
Yeah, yeah and you're feeling so much better
you're feeling so much better</p>

<p>Sweet thing, sweet thing
all you get is nothing
sweet thing, sweet thing
all you get is nothing when you put nothing in</p>
