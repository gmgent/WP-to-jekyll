<p>We did it. We didn't train very much but still got through a pretty tough 13.1 miles. The starting line was at Universal city, we ran down Highland to Hollywood boulevard, all the way east to Vermont, and then retraced back up Highland and finished in Studio City. The last two miles were a serious problem for me. The hill was too much and I just cramped up completely.</p>

<p>Here are our times:</p>

<p>2 hours and 19 minutes on the nose for me, and for Lavinia just under 2 hours and 27 minutes. Not too shabby. We both wanted to beat 2.5 hours which we did.</p>

<p>Also my splits were pretty interesting, I was on my way to a pretty great time except that the last two miles just killed me. That was far and away the fastest 10 miles I have ever run and then that hill put me in my place. Ah well.</p>

<p>Sure, it was downhill, but I had a mile at 9 minutes, one at 8:10, and one at 8:30. For 3 consecutive miles, I was averaging 8 1/2 minute miles, which for me is pretty solid. Lavinia and I both had a great time. We love to run. A special shout-out to G-mama for taking care of the Moosh for us.</p>
