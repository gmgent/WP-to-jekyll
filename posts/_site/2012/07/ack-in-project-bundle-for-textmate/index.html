<p>I am setting up a new workstation so I had to add Ack In Project again and I figured I'd post the link here so I don't have to look for it again.</p>

<pre>
    cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles/

    git clone git://github.com/protocool/ack-tmbundle.git Ack.tmbundle
</pre>


<p>you may have to add the Bundles directory if you don't have it already.</p>
