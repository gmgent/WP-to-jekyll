<p>It is possible that <strong>Somewhere</strong> gets by the gatekeeper for admission into the Radio Paradise playlist. That would be groovy. They are notoriously picky, and it is a privately run internet radio so it is up to the opinion of only 2 people. I am by no means approved yet but at least a song is getting reviewed now. The previous 5 were 'sorried' immediately. Oh the cruel whim of whimsy!</p>

<p>Please support <a href="http://www.radioparadise.com/">Radio Paradise</a> because they are awesome.</p>
