<p>In computability theory, the halting problem is a decision problem which can be stated as follows: given a description of a program and a finite input, decide whether the program finishes running or will run forever, given that input.</p>


<p>Alan Turing proved in 1936 that a general algorithm to solve the halting problem for all possible program-input pairs cannot exist. We say that the halting problem is undecidable over Turing machines.</p>


<p>And p = np : </p>


<p>In essence, the question P = NP? asks: if 'yes'-answers to a 'yes'-or-'no'-question can be verified "quickly" (in polynomial time), can the answers themselves also be computed quickly?</p>

<p>I don't know why, but I love this stuff. I personally think <b>p</b> <i>DOES</i> equal <b>np</b> but I can't prove it.</p>
