<p>There is some good domestic money in the 'rescue package' - but most of it is still secretly lining the pockets of Citigroup. Let us make no mistake - I had a discussion about this yesterday - our financial system is still crumbling, and Obama has TOTALLY sided with the banks. He is only OCCASIONALLY a champion of the people.</p>


<p>Where is the mortgage relief for homeowners? Why is our government paying top dollar for toxic assets, essentially using tax dollars to keep criminal banking interests solvent? Why is the war still growing? Why do banks get bailed out over and over, while auto workers are SOL?</p>


<p>And finally, why are a million people still declaring bankruptcy every year because they can't afford to pay their health care bills? Where is a people's champion for that?</p>

<p>Geithner has since pushed the Obama administration to approach the banking crisis not in response to the needs of destitute homeowners but rather from the side of the bankers who are seizing their homes. Instead of keeping people in their homes with a freeze on foreclosures, he has rewarded the unscrupulous lenders who conned ordinary folks.</p>


<p>He still wants to give more money to Citigroup, which has just been found woefully short of cash by Treasury's auditors, and has not stopped Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and some other big banks ostensibly under government influence, and indeed sometimes ownership, from recently ending their temporary moratoriums on housing foreclosures. Geithner has been in the forefront of coddling the banks in the hopes that welfare for the rich will trickle down to suffering homeowners, but that has not happened.</p>
