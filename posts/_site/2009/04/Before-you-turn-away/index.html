<p>I left my broken down in Texas<br />
the road has never felt so long<br />
along the way I start to wonder<br />
who will miss me when I&#039;m gone?</p>


<p>if you don&#039;t mind waiting<br />
for the news to break<br />
before you turn away<br />
before you turn away<br />
if you don&#039;t mind waiting<br />
for the news to break<br />
before you turn away</p>


<p>Some say there&#039;s nothing after dying<br />
that all we have is in this world<br />
I don&#039;t know much about tomorrow<br />
but right now I feel pretty good</p>


<p>if you don&#039;t mind waiting<br />
for the drugs to take<br />
before you turn away<br />
before you turn away<br />
if you don&#039;t mind waiting<br />
for the drugs to take<br />
before you turn away</p>


<p>it&#039;s a life worth saving<br />
and a chance worth taking<br />
before you turn away<br />
before you turn away<br />
it&#039;s a life worth saving<br />
and a chance worth taking<br />
before you turn away</p>
