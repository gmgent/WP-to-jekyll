<p>Tomorrow we start out on the road. Check out the <a href="http://noonchild.com/muse/kristeraxel_blog-0">Journey to New Earth</a> page for more info on where we're going. Missouri, Wisconsin, Minnesota here we come.<br />
Thanks to everyone that came out to the last few shows. Both the Gig and the Farmers' Market were real highlights for me. Here's a video of me playing a new song <b>Summer Drug</b>.</p>

I love being on the road. Songs write themselves when you are traveling. September is my favorite month to see the country.<br /><br />
I haven't played a show in Madison since I left in 1999. This is also a first time having a partner in crime on the road with me (Lavinia is coming along). We are going to have a great time.<br /><br />
I'll try to post updates from the road.<br /><br />
See you in the heartland!<br /><br />
