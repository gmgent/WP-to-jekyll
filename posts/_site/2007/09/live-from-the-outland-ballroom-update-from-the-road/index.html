<p>Missouri is a beautiful place.<br /><br />
Wisconsin and Minnesota aren't so bad either.<br />
I just got back to Los Angeles, so it might take me a while to put up some more shots but they'll be up by the end of the week. We also got some video from a few of the shows. The tour was a total success. Special thanks to:</p>


<p><b>Nate</b> for hooking it up in Madison<br />
<b>Nick</b> for setting up the <b>New Earth</b> show<br />
<b>Christopher</b> at the Weary Traveller</p>


<p>We sold cds, we spread the word, and we realized that I should probably do my version of <i>Hallelujah</i> at every show. Good to know. :)<br />
