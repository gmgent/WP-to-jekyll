<p>it occurs to me in hesitation
that the circle spins forever
something about an exit seems so
unbroken so deep so explosive
and we are only at the window
cheeks pressed against the glass
in wait for this freedom so
pale so tired so unsatisfying
when everything seems empty
and the mirror draws blood
I am lost in these mental boxes
the labyrinth of dull desire
and I am with you on this gentle slope
the slow motion of small disaster
this is only a physical distance
remember that we smile at the same sun
there is no peace here that I did not
raise from chaos I imagine
it is the same for you</p>
