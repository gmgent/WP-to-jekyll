<p>Sadly, even Barack is drinking the Kool-Aid on this one:</p>
<p>" I say this based on my experience as the former head of the TVA, which bought and burned more than 30 million tons of coal a year. I was deeply involved in the strip mining, underground mining, trucking, and most importantly, the burning of huge quantities of coal. No one who has been deeply involved with coal can rightfully say it is clean. 	”</p>
