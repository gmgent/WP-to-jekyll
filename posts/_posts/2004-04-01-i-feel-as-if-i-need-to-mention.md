I recently started journalling again, in the end of 2010. It feels good to get back to something I love. What is interesting is that as I am sifting through all of my old hard drives, both in order to migrate all of my blog posts to this new site and to finally do my backups into the cloud - as opposed to hard drives that have to be constantly synced and may fail at any moment - I am finding some great stuff. Old pictures that I thought I had lost, poems that I never published, songs and song ideas that never made it through the vetting process but in retrospect were pretty awesome and also some old pages of what were journal entries in the strictest sense. I was speaking directly to myself, with a deep sense of loneliness, regret and most of all pain. It is deeply personal stuff but for the most part harmless so I am posting it now in the hope that whoever reads it (if anyone) can keep an open mind. It is part of my struggle to be the best and most evolved person I know how to be. This period of journaling lasted from December of 2002 to February of 2004 and then just fell off a cliff. I'm not sure why I stopped - I think finally had a web site that I blogged on, and I seem to have picked back up <a href="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/2006/01/blog-entries-from-2005/">in early 2005</a>.

Anyway, there is a lot of craziness in here, the rantings of a chain-smoking, whiskey-drinking insomniac; but also some wisdom scattered about and clearly glimpses of a wounded soul coming to terms with life and what can only be referred to as truly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existentialism">Existential angst</a>.
