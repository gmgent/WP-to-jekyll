<p>this is a work in progress.</p>
<p>Harley was a friend<br />
right up until the end<br />
who never got his chance to shine<br />
but Harley got his share<br />
of what was in the air<br />
and Harley was a friend of mine.<br />
Harley simplified<br />
the wherefores and the whys<br />
into a simple right or wrong<br />
you knew that you were right<br />
if it got you through the night<br />
and you ended up somewhere with food<br />
a starry blanket sky<br />
and a wink in Jenni&#039;s eye<br />
was all he needed to feel good.</p>
