<p>I have wanted so much<br />
from today. To see changes<br />
from a distance,<br />
not like this<br />
with my own flesh<br />
beside the furnace.<br />
And what<br />
of the paths we dig<br />
in the earth, sinking<br />
every day<br />
to our knees with habit<br />
carved into our faces?<br />
We were born to love<br />
to cry<br />
but not to hold our breath<br />
in the dark embrace<br />
of circumstance</p>
<p>today we make the promises<br />
tomorrow we keep them</p>
