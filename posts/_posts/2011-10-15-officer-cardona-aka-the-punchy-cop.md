You may have heard now about Officer Cardona the punchy NYPD officer.

On October 14th occupy.uslaw.com posted <a href="http://axel.me/4e">this</a>:

<blockquote><em>Officer Cardona— known to Occupy Wall Street legal observers as the officer whose violent reach across a police line to grab a demonstrator by the neck is thought to have precipitated  officer Anthony Bologna's infamous Pepper Spray attack — is reported to have punched another demonstrator in the face this morning.</em></blockquote>

You can see it online, there are <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=ows+punch&aq=f" target="_blank">plenty of Youtube versions</a>. It's amazing how documented this movement is. Just this week, we heard that <a href="http://axel.me/4f">mobile devices now outnumber people in the US</a>. I'm sure most of these devices have something resembling a camera and of course many of them probably also have some way to record video. No wonder many states are enacting laws that make taking video, photos, or audio of a police officer a crime. I would bet a lot of money that New York is trying pretty hard right now to ratchet up their existing law shielding police officers from video recordings. I have been <a href="http://axel.me/4g">saying it for years</a>: this is quickly becoming a police state. Does anyone remember the <a href="http://axel.me/4h">ongoing Posse Comitatus violation that started in 2008</a>? They announced it in the <a href="http://axel.me/4i">Army Times</a>, after all. This is a systemic problem and I think it is absolutely a corollary to the problems that we have now with the big banks. Any successful kleptocracy needs henchmen. There is a culture in media and government (both <a href="http://axel.me/4k">wholly owned subsidiaries of the corporations</a>) that protests like <strong>OccupyWallStreet</strong> are just full of hippies and <a href="http://axel.me/4j">'left-wing nutbars'</a> but somehow the Tea Party has nothing but legitimate concerns.

It's enough to make you feel a little crazy, like it's all slipping away and there is nothing to be done about it. I think that's why <strong>OccupyWallStreet</strong> is enjoying such widespread support - something the <a href=" http://axel.me/4">Tea Party</a> never had. Ever since Obama turned out to be such a disappointment, people have been waiting for somewhere to invest a little hope.

I have made donations at <a href="http://www.occupywallst.org/">occupywallst.org</a> and you should too. Anyone in the 99% - which is everyone, knowing how <a href="http://axel.me/4m" target="_blank">invisible the super-rich really are</a> - should get behind this movement. <strong>OccupyWallStreet</strong> is about putting some of the power back in the hands of the people, where it belongs. It's as simple as that.
