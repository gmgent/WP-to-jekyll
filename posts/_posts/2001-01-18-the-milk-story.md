> when I moved back to Paris at the age of 11, I still had a bunch of
> friends in NY.
> So the first summer I was back - by then I guess I was twelve  - I had a
> friend come to visit.
> His name was Dennis.
> We all went to a town called Cavalier, which is kind of in between Nice
> and Monte Carlo in the south of France.
> Some family friends had time-shared a beautiful mansion - no joke, like 10
> bedrooms - right on some cliffs by the coast.
> Very cool.
> So it was my then-still-intact family, my friend Dennis, this other
> family, and some of their friends.
> One night after hanging out all day at our private beach, we all had
> dinner together.
> Dennis and I had some red wine with dinner - I was only 12, but I could
> handle it.
> Dennis, on the other hand, couldn't. He was feeling sick.
> My sister Katia, who had a nice buzz on, decided that the best thing to do
> would be for all of us to learn the words to her favorite Doug E Fresh
> song, you know, Ladi Dadi, we like to party - I think that's how it goes -
> so we could all sing it together.
> Anyway, that worked for a while - but it was getting late, and we were
> going to bed, and Dennis was still feeling sick.
> 
> So my mother, in her infinite wisdom, decided to warm up some milk, for
> him to drink, thinking that would help him sleep.
> He took a sip - and you could already tell that it was the worst possible
> thing for him to be putting in his body, just by his facial expression -
> but my mother didn't see that, she was just smiling at him, waiting for
> him to finish it.
> So Dennis, being the pushover that he was, just drank the rest of it in
> one gulp. My mother was satisfied with that, and kissed us all goodnight.
> The minute the door had closed, Dennis went running for the bathroom, and
> spent the next ten minutes reliving his dinner experience - with me and my
> sister singing Doug E Fresh. Ladi Dadi, we like to party, we don't cause
> trouble we don't, bother nobody...
> 
> And about a half hour later, we were all asleep, even Dennis. So maybe it
> worked, after all.
