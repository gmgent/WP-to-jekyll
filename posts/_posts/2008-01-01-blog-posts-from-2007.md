This is the last omni blog post, after this I started using RSS and the posts start getting broken up. This post was only part of the year and then the rest of the single-item posts start in.


<strong>haiku<br />
05.23.07</strong><br />
I have a firepit now. So I'm writing haiku about it.
<i>
The taming of fire<br />
We are all turned to ashes<br />
in the hot center<br />
</i>
<br />
<br />
In other news, I'm going to Europe for my cousin's wedding. Germany. I'll be playing piano at the reception in Stuttgart.
<br />
I will also be doing some performances at the Santa Monica Farmer's Market this year, making the big bucks (I just found out today).

<strong>a poem written in Mae Sot<br />
04.01.07</strong><br />
<br />
I found this today in a notebook I had with me over Christmas. 
This was written the morning after I spent my first night in Mae Sot (Thailand).
<br /><br /><br />

<i>A dog barks at the morning prayer<br />
and the sky remembers everything<br />

the smoke-filled houses<br />
leaned against each other<br />
the wild green hand of nature<br />
clutching at humanity. Go ahead<br />
and die, says the world<br />
we will not find you<br />
in your toothpick temples<br />
eating rice and leaves. Your children<br />
are not lucky enough to feel<br />
the breath of medicine.<br />
There is no love to spare.</i><br />

The pictures from Thailand and Burma are now here. <br /><br />

The story:<br /><br />
Last year in December, both Lavinia and I traveled to Thailand to visit her mother Selia who has volunteered for almost a year now as a teacher's teacher for an organization called <b>The Curriculum Project</b>. We spent most of our time in Mae Sot, which is an important border town between Thailand and Burma.<br />
Many of the Burmese refugee camps are in this area. Most Burmese refugees are of Karen descent, and are the only remaining freedom fighters against the heavy-handed Burmese government - since the Buddhist Karenni faction sold out to the Burmese military regime just a few years ago. There is always hope that these kind-hearted Burmese peasants will find peace and prosperity some day soon. Click the contact link above left if you would like to donate directly to the orphans in the photos depicted here.<br /><br />
While we were there, General Bo Mya passed away in his late seventies, who was easily the most important spokesperson for the Christian Karen faction. Bo Mya was quite literally a folk hero and military legend. Attending his funeral in Burma (Myanmar) was a once-in-a-lifetime experience for Lavinia, her brother John, her mother Selia and I.

I'm working on a few things right now - radio promotion, media, and a photo essay on my travels to Thailand.
<br />
For now, I leave you with this photo, of Karen refugees at their stronghold in Burma -
