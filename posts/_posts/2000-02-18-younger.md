Like a fool when I was younger
I would burn to feed my hunger
everything that I stood on
like a spider eats her young
like the doorways just get lower
the traffic just gets slower
like living just gets dirty
like 5 o'clock should be 5:30

in a way I haven't changed
I still answer to my name
I stll put good where there was evil
I still have faith in decent people

The world that we live in
there's a bill going through it
stacks of money changing hands
I could buy myself a chance

Like a fool when I was younger
I put my hand right in the fire
I stood and faced the eyes of love
I knew too little or too much
but like the day I never met you
of all the things I could hold on to
it makes no sense to be alone
if we share the journey home

in a way I haven't changed
if that means I stay the same
like the Europeans say
plus ca change plus c'est la meme chose

The world that we live in
it's a thousand different colors
it's the infinite lover
the mother of mothers
The world that we live in
it's a thousand shades of grey
every word I didn't say
every gift that no one gave

The world that we live in
is bigger than a coffee cup
and it won't get filled up
if the spiders eat their young
