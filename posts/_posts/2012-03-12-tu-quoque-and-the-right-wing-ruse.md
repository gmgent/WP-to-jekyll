<strong>tu quoque</strong>:

<blockquote>(Latin for "you, too" or "you, also") or the appeal to hypocrisy, is a logical fallacy that attempts to discredit the opponent's position by asserting his failure to act consistently in accordance with that position; it attempts to show that a criticism or objection applies equally to the person making it. This dismisses someone's point of view based on criticism of the person's inconsistency, and not the position presented. Thus, it is a form of the ad hominem argument.</blockquote>

<strong>ruse</strong>:

<blockquote>a wily subterfuge; an action or plan which is intended to deceive someone.</blockquote>

As an example, here is a little exchange from the interwebs about so-called 'Slut-Gate'.

<a href="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/tu-quoque.png"><img src="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/tu-quoque-253x300.png" alt="" title="tu-quoque" width="253" height="300" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1696" /></a>

<em>I apologize to America that the left, who specializes [sic] in throwing crass insults, can't take what they dish out.</em>

This is it in a nutshell. Here is the angle: redirect the argument with a logical fallacy that circumvents the matter completely, and then proceed with a few unprovable statements:

<em>political correctness is more important than dialogue</em>

and finish up with some lies.

Calling someone a slut publicly is not 'dialogue'; political correctness, to my mind at least was always about terminology and a sort of collective awareness of our own multicultural and interpersonal sensitivities. This does fall somewhere squarely under the banner of misogyny but more importantly it just fails the basic test of human decency. Disrespect is disrespect.

The fact that both the <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2011/02/22/exclusive-militarys-persona-software-cost-millions-used-for-classified-social-media-activities/">military</a> and the private sector are pouring a lot of money every year into supporting 'anonymous voices' like this one here, is just as shameful as the hate speech of guys like Rush Limbaugh.

Those are some cluttered and wacky echo chambers out there, with a lot of manipulated consensus. I joke a little, and that is a very general statement, but the truth is that we don't know how big it is. All of that information is classified - but we do know that the national security budget is in the billions and there are plenty of think tanks out there with a lot of interest in manipulating public opinion.

It is so easy to redirect the conversation with a just a little bit of inflammatory hate speech, and I try to click through to view the profile of whoever it is when I see that stuff. Either they are 'anonymous' like the one I used an example, or they invariably just opened the account a month or two ago and they have a lot of comments on only a few blog posts. Our world is far more compassionate than the DOD and the oil lobby would have us believe. Ever since environmentalism met up with the cause of liberals there has been a systematic demonization of stinky hippies, tree-hugging liberals and really any sort of get-a-real-job artist types. It is not nice and it is not friendly. Here is a bad example:

<a href="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/liberals-are-not-humans.png"><img src="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/liberals-are-not-humans.png" alt="" title="liberals-are-not-humans" width="466" height="76" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1698" /></a>

Is this what we have come to? Complete dehumanization of the other side? By my own argument, at worst this is nothing more than another false consensus but even as a page out of the playbook of these shadowy social media manipulators beholden to whatever corporate holy grail they may be it is some scary stuff.

UPDATE: also, the right wingers are just mean. <a href="http://axel.me/8o">Killing a cat and scrawling 'liberal' on it</a>? Show me one liberal nut job who would do something like that. The right wing is where crazies <em>live</em>.
