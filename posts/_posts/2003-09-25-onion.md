<p>Wine<br />
I spent too much on me<br />
Last night<br />
I felt your body breathe<br />
Your heart<br />
Burning next to me</p>
<p>So<br />
Here we are again<br />
Fireflies<br />
Lighting up the fence<br />
You spin<br />
Further into me<br />
We're at the end</p>
<p>I've waited here for someone<br />
Who peels herself an onion<br />
With the hand of patience<br />
If I stand in your favor<br />
It's a gift I'll open later<br />
Like a flame burning backwards</p>
