And everyone is just doing their thing…

I'm thinking of Chad, my old friend/enemy who moved to San Francisco and took his rock chick with him… I think of seeing Courtney, all decked out in ultra-modern trashy punk chic who I saw looking at fruit in Ralph's right off of Formosa with Vanessa on my arm; and look at us now. All separated, and shit.
I wonder if Korena will respond. If I had to put money on it - well, I won't say. I don't want to jinx it.
And I forget sometimes - it seems more often than not - but I still have it, I have this passion and this intensity… It's right at the point where I don't really give a shit anymore, that everything becomes easy again. I am living in a circle.
So tonight, I celebrated my own rediscovery. Another spin around the sun. French martinis - Frenchtinis - and a hell of a cheeseburger. With a salad afterwards -
because I don't want to lose sight. It's right when you get close that you lose hope. I could be right around the corner from another shift in the right direction.
I cannot hesitate any longer. I decide, I move, I reassess. My instincts have developed, I can fully trust myself… To really have the ability, I can be a guitar player - because I want to. It's all just a question of time.
I am moving in the right direction reasonably fast. This year, I think, will mean a lot. The world will finally know what I've been up to.

Love
