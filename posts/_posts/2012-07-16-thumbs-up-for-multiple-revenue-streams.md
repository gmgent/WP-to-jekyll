This is one of the best quarters I've had yet and is just distribution revenue, which is mainly paid downloads and streaming. I also get little bumps for both the sync revenue and writer/publishing royalties, so this is starting to add up to more than just peanuts. I think I may be looking an actual Snickers bar.
