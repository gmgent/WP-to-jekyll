<p>The moon broad and tempestuous<br />
lacking shadow<br />
has descended across the evening<br />
and the empty sky<br />
as if I am not alone driving<br />
not turning the wheel<br />
returned from the day like<br />
a candle extinguished.<br />
To search again for life<br />
with the eyes of a poet I will give<br />
weight to this shift in the heavens<br />
even as there is no witness<br />
no curve in the joking of your eyes<br />
I keep no record<br />
of such things. Let us both be free<br />
in the corners of the world<br />
and it will matter little<br />
that the circle is open</p>
