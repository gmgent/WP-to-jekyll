<p>Goldman spokesman Michael DuVally says no tarp money is going to bonuses: "The compensation that was paid to employees came out of our business activities.” Charles Geisst, finance professor at Manhattan College and author of the upcoming Collateral Damaged: The Marketing of Consumer Debt to America, begs to differ. "If they didn't have the tarp money, they would be forced to raise fresh capital,” he says. "Now, I agree it's a long-term item on the balance sheet. But [without the government money] they would have to take a dip into what operating profits they have left, and reduce those salaries. So the tarp money is a substitute. Theirs is an extremely disingenuous argument.” Counters DuVally, "Professor Geisst is wrong. We paid bonuses out of earnings, not capital.” But as former compensation consultant Graef Crystal put it on Bloomberg.com, "The argument of saying we're not using the bailout money is just crap because money's fungible. Money's money. It exposes them to ridicule.”</p>
