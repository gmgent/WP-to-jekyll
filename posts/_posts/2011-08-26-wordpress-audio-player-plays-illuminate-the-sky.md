My sister called me last night to announce that my music is on the Friday Night Lights DVD. I knew that already but it was still nice to hear about it. Here is one of the songs from that DVD. I need to test this audio plug-in.

Head over to <a href="http://axelradio.com/album/swexico" title="bandcamp" target="_blank">bandcamp</a> and download the whole album for free (or whatever you can afford) if you like it. It's one of my favorites. The song is <strong>Illuminate The Sky</strong> from the EP <em>Swexico</em>.

EDIT: lyrics added per Selia:



<blockquote>
I woke up today and my voice was 
Older than my heart 
Which carries a new scar 
The image of a better place 
Let me see the earth dressed 
For the seasons 

Diamonds in the street 
Spotlights in the wild 
Tonight I watch an angel 
Shoot across the sky 
Illuminate the sky 

Even as my dreams run slowly 
Beneath this printed sunset 
They begin to die 
We replace the impossible 
With the same wicked fever 
That burned heaven to the ground 

Diamonds in the street 
Spotlights in the wild 
Tonight I watch an angel 
Illuminate the sky 
Shoot across the sky 

I opened up my veins 
Showed you what I believe 
I hope you never change 
I hope you never change 
I hope you will always shine 
I hope you never change 

The stars in your eyes 
Illuminate the sky
