<strong>oBriens Pub in Santa Monica<br />
12.01.06</strong><br />
<br />
I played a few songs along with some other guests, most notably my good friend and killer songwriter Jay Sousa from 50 Cent Haircut. I sit in with his band on keys whenever I can. The night was very cool. Being back at O'Briens will always remind me of my Paper Sun days.

<strong>New Shows<br />

11.19.06</strong><br />
<br />
I'll be in San Fran this weekend for a show, I'm looking forward to that. <b>Arms Around the River</b> will be mastered on Dec. 7th
 and then I'll send it out to be pressed - the cd release party will be at the <b>Hotel Cafe</b> in Hollywood early next year.
 
<br />
These are some of my best songs yet - Marc Moreau did the mixing, along with my friend Brandon Krueger who mixed a few tracks and Cythia Catania who had a hand in it as well.
<br />
This will be the third album I've produced and I am really getting the hang of it.
<br />
For the record, the songs that I have had playing from my site for the last few months are not the songs that will be featured on the album - I have some outtakes, some 
really esoteric Krister Axel songs, and some live stuff available here on the website that WILL NOT be featured on the next album (not all of it, at least). I'm sorry if I did not make that clear early on.

<br />

I guess maybe there really is a market for the Krister Axel version of <b>Georgia On My Mind</b>.<br /><br />
I suppose I'll have to put out a cover album <i>a la</i> <b>Perfect Day</b> by Chris Whitley. That'll be my next project.<br /><br />

<strong>The Freeze<br />
09.11.06</strong><br /><br />

<small>I found this in an old notebook, dated 05.17.1997 (written in Madison, WI).</small><br /><br />
just this little stash of survival
<br />never had a moment to think
<br />radio voices sound like someone I know
<br />moonlight makes me want to have a drink
<br />I listen to the rhythm of the traffic
<br />hiding in the silence I project
<br />push me through the womb of the future
<br />bear me as an infant to protect
<br />an island on the ocean planet 'solo'
<br />wailing of the unborn tragedy
<br />wiping from my eyes the mess of martyrs
<br />the burden of my passage through the freeze
<br />

<strong>The Playboy Mansion<br />
08.26.06</strong><br /><br />
For the record, I never cancel a show. I have to go back to March 10th, 1995, for the last show cancellation that
I was ever party to. Over ten years ago - at <b>The Chamber</b>, Madison, WI (no longer there). Good times.<br /><br />
Anyway, the reason was that I had an invitation to the Playboy Mansion that I couldn't refuse. So thank you all for being so understanding.

This is Hef's pet Toucan. He's got monkeys, rabbits, birds. It is literally a zoo. A really little one. I didn't like it at all. Very natural
looking, except of course for all the cages.<br /><br />
I hate to be judgemental, and I am not intimate with the details, but it does seem to me that if people like Hef each gave a small
but significant push for progressive politics instead of stuffing Toucans into cages, we might not be in quite the mess that we are now.
Anyway, thanks for the invite buddy. <br /><br />
So that's it and here I am - signing off from Hef's mini-zoo, where the playmates still wear the same outfits, but now in modern pastels.

<strong>Sunset Boulevard<br />

08.15.06</strong><br /><br />
I work on Sunset now<br />
where dreams die and take shape<br />
where highways are twisted at the throat<br />
of the green that once was<br />
sometimes with more choice<br />
comes less freedom<br />
more sugar in place of food<br />
sirens for a handshake<br />

bright lights casting longer<br />
and longer shadows<br />
soon the earth will erupt<br />
and reshape the landscapes<br />
in her likeness<br />
to invade the invaders<br />
with mountains for fingers<br />
she brushes the cities<br />
from her brow. As if<br />

to invent a simple fabric<br />
between God and Man<br />
she turns over<br />
her bed<br />

<strong>Jamaica<br />
08.07.06</strong><br />
<br /> <font color="#666666"><small><i>August fights with bold teeth

<br />the rumor of a cold winter</i></font></small>
<br /><br />I don't know why I said that. It never gets cold in Los Angeles.
<br /><br />I was in Jamaica not much more than a month ago. It feels like much longer than that - it is amazing how long you can put things off for.
We were there for the 4th of July and it was in full bloom, the sun was hot and the breeze was cold. The streets in the big cities were mostly
all right and the highway to Negril was almost new, but everywhere else there are holes in the street like missing teeth.
The land is so rich and green but the people are very poor. Buildings everywhere along the smaller highways stand in a half-constructed ethereal realm.
The whole western island seems to be in perpetual work-in-progress mode where the bags of gravel lay untended and the doors are all open as if the notice
came suddenly that there was no reason to work anymore.<br /><br />
We had a great time and Jamaica is a gorgeous country but it is a bit unsettling to know how much power money has been given in our society.<br />
Lavinia and I rented a car in Montego Bay and drove all the way to Treasure Beach. It was such a long drive that we decided to
split it up on the way back and stay in Negril for the night en route.

This is Lavinia, in all her hotness. There is not much more to say about this picture, she is the love of my life and it is also quite obvious that she is the sexiest woman that has ever lived. Here she is just outside <b>Jack Sprat's</b>. The water was very blue at that beach.
That was a good day.
<br /><br />I brought my <i>Martin</i> and played it a lot. Lazy days.

Our room was totally private, right on the water. The ocean was very loud but we loved it.
<br /><br />

I got to play some music, I played a few songs during the set break one night at the hotel. It was totally unplanned and was a real highlight for me.
I met a jamaican musician named Toby One and we became friends. Cool man. His friend Wendell played tambourine and held the mic stand.
<br />
People all over the world are amazingly gracious and giving. Everyone we met was essentially kind. It is just a shame that such a beautiful
place can be in effect annexed by big-business tourism without the people of Jamaica ending up with much of anything at all.

These are the lyrics to my new song <i>Summer Drug</i>, in honor of my new friend <a href="http://www.KimDellavedova.com" target="_blank">Kim Dellavedova</a>.

<br />
We did a show together last week at <strong>The Stone</strong> and it was very cool. <i>Summer Drug</i> was the first song I played and the one Kim liked the best. As it turns out we are both mad for <a href="http://www.chriswhitley.com/" target="_blank">Chris Whitley</a>. I was just listening to <strong>A Perfect Day</strong> yesterday and thinking what a gift that album was. Thank you Chris. You are still loved around the world.<br />

Kim tells me there is a video rental shop in Melbourne where she grew up that is constantly playing <strong>Loco Girl</strong> and other songs off of <strong>Dirt Floor</strong> for the customers, and if you can guess the name of the song they will give you a free rental. If only I lived next to a place like that where they serve drinks.

<br />
<i>Peace for the winter I pray for you
<br />
that you find what you wanted to

<br />
you get no second chances babe
<br />
you walk out in the pouring rain
<br />
you get some kind of lost again<br />
<br />
I've been waiting for you<br />
to change your mind<br />
I'm learning how to turn back time<br />
I'll say good night but I don't mean mine<br />
You're a summer drug

You're still blind from the summer flame
<br />
love-drunk and whisky-tame
<br />
on that old yesterday
<br />
you wake up and see the sky
<br />

you got no good reasons why<br />
you're not just wasting time<br /><br />
I've been waiting for you<br />
to change your mind...<br />

Everyone is confirmed for <strong><i>Roots Rock for Lovers</i></strong>.
<br />
I have always wanted to play a show at <strong>the Stone</strong>. It is right in Hollywood and I know the lights
will be shining on us in the hip dive room of our time. Hollywood is the new West Hollywood which puts Koreatown in
as the next Hollywood.<br />
Anyway <strong>Sally Jaye</strong> is a total heartbreaker, <strong>Shawn Pander</strong> is like molasses on
broken glass and <strong>Brandon Krandon</strong> will make you believe. We got everything
from a diddled-eyed Joe to a damned if I know.

<br />I'm glad you'll be going. They serve 4 kinds of whisky and I plan to try every one.
<br />
<br />Get there early, stay late and drink just like it's Saturday.
<br />I will be playing acoustic guitar for the first time in a while, and if the wind blows right I may get my
 harmonium shipped from England just in time to play it for you.

I was talking to a friend of mine last week, and he asked me what I've been up to.<br />
I replied that I was adding some informative current events
links to my home page in such a way that I can update and append to them often and easily.
His reply was: <i>what are you doing that for</i>?<br /><br />

- which I thought was sort of odd. We are literally exploding the federal deficit, funneling hundreds of billions
of taxpayer dollars every year into wrong-headed priorities for a clumsy military. International diplomacy is at an all-time low
and the value of the dollar is eroding but you wouldn't know it by watching TV or reading any of the major newspapers. <br />
Not to mention the completely overt lawlessness of a power-drunk and peerlessly incompetent administration.<br />
Yet, there is no perceived need for unbiased information.<br />
That's a lot of kool-aid.

Coronado is very cool. Many thanks to Nancy Peace for hooking us up with a great gig.<br /><br />
Tomorrow the band is tracking with an A-list engineer in a badass recording studio and I am really looking forward to it.<br /><br />

<strong>05.15.06</strong><br /><br />
<br />Yesterday was my birthday.
<br />

<br />Life is really good these days. My new album <strong>iMTHEGUN</strong> is coming along nicely. 
I have a recording session coming up at <a href="http://www.newmonkeystudio.com/" target="_blank">NEW MONKEY STUDIOS</a>, 
which some of us will remember as the studio that was
a labor of love for <strong>Elliot Smith</strong>, that tragic and beautiful poet.
<br /><br />
It will be a very deep experience to explore my own creativity as a songwriter and composer on his beloved keyboards. I have
always found that every instrument has its own voice and personality, and this is even more true for vintage keyboards like antique pianos
 from 1917 and a 50's-era harmonium. Sigh.
 <br /> <br />
 Every time I meet a new piano, a song is written. This has never failed me.<br />
 The best part is that I am finally doing a recording to tape in a place where I know the air will be full 
 of muses and electricity and above all, microphones.
 <br /><br />

I won't be gigging very much this summer, but if you live near San Diego you can catch a show with the full band 
on <strong>Coronado Island</strong>.<br />
It's an outdoor Cancer Benefit called <strong>RELAY FOR LIFE</strong> on SAT JUNE 10th.<br /><br />
Yes, I'm having two birthday parties;<br />
and yes, I quit the <strong>Cheyenne Kimball</strong> band, for reasons that shall remain private - I will say only that we parted on good terms and I wish her nothing but the best. <br>
I think on the <strong>MHD Network</strong> they are still airing a live show that I did with her in Breckinridge this past January.

<br />Highlights:
<li>Witnessing a true legend perform, Ian McLagan.</li>
<li>Jamming with John Popper. He literally walked in off the street while I was playing a song, and stepped up to the mic with his harmonica. It was gorgeous.</li>

<li>I will be honored to help host the <strong>Amoeba Records</strong> sponsored
<strong>Gram Parsons </strong> Tribute at this year's <strong>South by Southwest</strong> Music Festival.
The amazing line-up musicians that I will be performing with includes members of Wilco, The Minus 5, and REM. This whole weekend in Austin is going to be completely surreal.</li>
<br />
<li>Amoeba Records will feature me in March as a <strong>Homegrown Artist</strong>. Hell yeah I'm homegrown. Look out for ads in the LA Weekly and the Campus Circle.</li>

<br />
<li>And I love this picture, taken in Breckinridge last month courtesy of my friend Noah over at <strong>MTV</strong>. </li><br /><br />

      We kicked it off with a show at the Mint, my friends Chris Pierce, Foster Timms, Jay Nash and I. And then I went right to Vegas.<br />

        I've been playing keys lately with Sony/Epic artist Cheyenne Kimball and it's pretty awesome. In the past month I've met some very cool people from both Sony and MTV. Cheyenne's new show on MTV will be airing early this summer, called <strong>Cheyenne 15</strong>. <br />
        <br />
      Yup, she's 15 and she rocks.   <br />
      So while I'm writing more songs for my next album I'll be on the road with Cheyenne. Here are some photos from our show at the Breckenridge Riverwalk Center for the MHD Network<strong> Music with Altitude</strong> Concert Series. It was about 10 degrees Fahrenheit but who cares - this is rock and roll, baby.<br />

        This show will was filmed in HD and will be airing on the new MHD network sometime in late February/early March. 
      Here's a look at my keyboard rig. Hey Nord, where's my sponsorship? That's a Nord Modular on top and a Nord Electro.<br />

      This was the view from my hotel room. Nice place. Not a lot of air, though. You lose your breath just tying your shoes when you're up close to the sky like that. <br />

It's fun for about 45 seconds and then it gets annoying. Poor Cheyenne didn't have a moment's peace. MTV was very cool though, good people. Thank god for that, it could have been a lot worse.

        So that's it for now, I'm putting the final touches on another EP release that I'm hoping to have finished by the end of the Spring. I've been working with a few new producers, Cynthia Catania and Brandon Krueger and some others. Stay tuned for more updates... And happy new year!
