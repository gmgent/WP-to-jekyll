<p>you were always out of town<br />
i was always on the way<br />
i could barely see the light<br />
but you could blind me just the same<br />
no one ever knew the truth<br />
but you were always on my mind<br />
all i saw was you<br />
i was waiting for a sign<br />
we were lovers then<br />
we were lovers all the time</p>
<p>you could never stay too long<br />
because you always had to work<br />
but i did the best i could<br />
and you showed me what it&#039;s worth<br />
i never rushed a thing<br />
i was careful just like you<br />
you took my only heart<br />
and kept me for your fool<br />
we were lover then<br />
even if you made the rules</p>
<p>i could find your heart<br />
in the pitch black dark<br />
when the colors run<br />
and the night has just begun<br />
i will never stray<br />
i won&#039;t lose my way<br />
as long as i have you<br />
as long as i have you</p>
<p>we&#039;re here with all our friends<br />
this night will never end<br />
now we stare across the sea<br />
now your love is here with me<br />
now we&#039;ll never be apart<br />
now I know just who you are<br />
you&#039;re the one I&#039;d hoped to find<br />
I was searching all the time<br />
so let&#039;s celebrate<br />
let&#039;s celebrate tonight</p>
<p>as long as i have you<br />
i will never be afraid<br />
i will never lose my way</p>
<p>as long as i have you</p>
