<strong>If it were not for Steve:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>I would probably still be a Windows developer.</li>
  <li>My laptop would be a lot uglier.</li>
  <li>I would probably still have a cable TV subscription.</li>
  <li>I wouldn't love to hate iTunes so much.</li>
  <li>I wouldn't be tempted every day to buy an iPhone.</li>
  <li>I wouldn't be tempted every day to buy an iPad.</li>
  <li>The software development community would probably be very different and certainly for the worse.</li>
  <li><em>Finding Nemo</em> would never have made me cry.</li>
  <li>Today would not be such a sad day.</li>
</ul>


Rest in peace, great man.<br>
