	                            <p><p align="justify"><i>Of course, underneath the veneer of fresh-faced optimism that Obama is pushing -- note that the word "idealism" isn't appropriate here, because Obama isn't selling idealism so much as a kind of reinvigorated, feel-good pragmatism -- there operates a massive, well-oiled political machine no less ruthless and ambitious than that of his establishment rival, Hillary Clinton. Obama has raised $80 million, and it would be a grievous mistake to describe his candidacy as a grass-roots affair, particularly when he counts among his bundlers many of the lobbyists and political-finance pros who buttress the Clinton run.</i></p>


<p>&lt;!--break--><i><br />
<p align="justify">Even a cursory glance at Obama's money men is enough to confirm that fact. The list includes Wall Street hotshots from Lehman Brothers, Oppenheimer and Co., and Citigroup, a smattering of Hollywood players and Native American casino interests, representatives of big pharmaceuticals and the insurance sector -- in short, all the major food groups of reviled corporate influence-hunters.</p>
<p align="justify">
Worse still, Obama's financial backing is reflected in some of his Senate votes and campaign positions, including most notably his support for expanding NAFTA to Peru, limiting the ability of injured workers and consumers to sue for damages, and pouring federal funds into E85 corn-based ethanol, an alternative fuel for which the market is dominated by the Illinois-based Archer Daniels Midland Company. More than once I heard Obama give stirring speeches, only to mar them with plugs for ethanol. </p></i></p>

<p align="justify">
Just for the record, I am not badmouthing Obama - Hilary, I think, would be MUCH WORSE as a president. But seriously, why can't we talk about Kucinich? He's the only real choice. Barack is a self-proclaimed Centrist. He's in bed with big money. He doesn't have a progressive bone in his body. The best case scenario for Barack is that he indirectly <i>enables</i> progressive change. I literally heard this from a NPR pundit. At this point in our national suicide, are we really looking for <i>a chance</i> at 'indirect' progressivism? Can a guy like Barack really take the Fizers and Wellpoints of the world to task? I don't think so. He is no FDR. He is barely to the left of Reagan - he's just not a sociopath (like Shrubby is). Is that really how far the bar has dropped?<br /><br />
Meanwhile, read this about Kucinich and his career as Mayor of Cleveland:</p>


<p align="justify">
<i>He was elected mayor of Cleveland in 1977 on the promise to save the city's municipally-owned electric system which offered customers significantly lower rates than the private utility.   A year later, Cleveland's banks demanded that he sell the city's 70 year-old municipally-owned electric system to its private competitor (in which the banks had a financial interest) as a precondition of extending credit to the city.</i></p>


<p align="justify">
The attempted political blackmail failed as did several assassination attempts.  He remembered his parents counting out coins on the dresser and refused to sell the people's power.  In an incident unprecedented in modern American politics, the Cleveland banks plunged the city into default for a mere $15 million despite being offered triple collateral to protect the loan.</p>


<p align="justify">
The principled stand destroyed his political career.   He lost his reelection bid.  He was demonized as the mayor who threw Cleveland into default.  Fifteen years later, the citizens of Cleveland - recognizing  he had saved them hundreds of millions of dollars in municipal power bills and also forced the private utility to keep bills low to compete - voted him into the Ohio Senate.   His campaign signs featured  a light bulb and the expression "Because he was right.”  In 1998 the Cleveland City Council honored Dennis for "..having the courage and foresight to refuse to sell the city's municipal electric system.” </p>


<p>That's who we need in the White House.</p>
