<p>awwhh, you know
you're making me blush...
no really, I have not gotten lucky in a little too long.
I'm sore from 35 minutes of aerobic kickboxing and a whole lot of
stretching.
Anyway, tonight should be easier.
I'll keep you posted...</p>

<p>the milk story: (I'll try to make this quick)</p>

<p>when I moved back to Paris at the age of 11, I still had a bunch of
friends in NY.
So the first summer I was back - by then I guess I was twelve  - I had a
friend come to visit.
His name was Dennis.
We all went to a town called Cavalier, which is kind of in between Nice
and Monte Carlo in the south of France.
Some family friends had time-shared a beautiful mansion - no joke, like 10
bedrooms - right on some cliffs by the coast.
Very cool.
So it was my then-still-intact family, my friend Dennis, this other
family, and some of their friends.
One night after hanging out all day at our private beach, we all had
dinner together.
Dennis and I had some red wine with dinner - I was only 12, but I could
handle it.
Dennis, on the other hand, couldn't. He was feeling sick.
My sister Katia, who had a nice buzz on, decided that the best thing to do
would be for all of us to learn the words to her favorite Doug E Fresh
song, you know, Ladi Dadi, we like to party - I think that's how it goes -
so we could all sing it together.
Anyway, that worked for a while - but it was getting late, and we were
going to bed, and Dennis was still feeling sick.</p>

<p>So my mother, in her infinite wisdom, decided to warm up some milk, for
him to drink, thinking that would help him sleep.
He took a sip - and you could already tell that it was the worst possible
thing for him to be putting in his body, just by his facial expression -
but my mother didn't see that, she was just smiling at him, waiting for
him to finish it.
So Dennis, being the pushover that he was, just drank the rest of it in
one gulp. My mother was satisfied with that, and kissed us all goodnight.
The minute the door had closed, Dennis went running for the bathroom, and
spent the next ten minutes reliving his dinner experience - with me and my
sister singing Doug E Fresh. Ladi Dadi, we like to party, we don't cause
trouble we don't, bother nobody...</p>

<p>And about a half hour later, we were all asleep, even Dennis. So maybe it
worked, after all.</p>

<p>That's the milk story.</p>

<p>how are you feeling, lush?</p></blockquote>
