<p>awwhh, you know<br />
you're making me blush...<br />
no really, I have not gotten lucky in a little too long.<br />
I'm sore from 35 minutes of aerobic kickboxing and a whole lot of<br />
stretching.<br />
Anyway, tonight should be easier.<br />
I'll keep you posted...</p><br />
<br />
<p>the milk story: (I'll try to make this quick)</p><br />
<br />
<p>when I moved back to Paris at the age of 11, I still had a bunch of<br />
friends in NY.<br />
So the first summer I was back - by then I guess I was twelve  - I had a<br />
friend come to visit.<br />
His name was Dennis.<br />
We all went to a town called Cavalier, which is kind of in between Nice<br />
and Monte Carlo in the south of France.<br />
Some family friends had time-shared a beautiful mansion - no joke, like 10<br />
bedrooms - right on some cliffs by the coast.<br />
Very cool.<br />
So it was my then-still-intact family, my friend Dennis, this other<br />
family, and some of their friends.<br />
One night after hanging out all day at our private beach, we all had<br />
dinner together.<br />
Dennis and I had some red wine with dinner - I was only 12, but I could<br />
handle it.<br />
Dennis, on the other hand, couldn't. He was feeling sick.<br />
My sister Katia, who had a nice buzz on, decided that the best thing to do<br />
would be for all of us to learn the words to her favorite Doug E Fresh<br />
song, you know, Ladi Dadi, we like to party - I think that's how it goes -<br />
so we could all sing it together.<br />
Anyway, that worked for a while - but it was getting late, and we were<br />
going to bed, and Dennis was still feeling sick.</p><br />
<br />
<p>So my mother, in her infinite wisdom, decided to warm up some milk, for<br />
him to drink, thinking that would help him sleep.<br />
He took a sip - and you could already tell that it was the worst possible<br />
thing for him to be putting in his body, just by his facial expression -<br />
but my mother didn't see that, she was just smiling at him, waiting for<br />
him to finish it.<br />
So Dennis, being the pushover that he was, just drank the rest of it in<br />
one gulp. My mother was satisfied with that, and kissed us all goodnight.<br />
The minute the door had closed, Dennis went running for the bathroom, and<br />
spent the next ten minutes reliving his dinner experience - with me and my<br />
sister singing Doug E Fresh. Ladi Dadi, we like to party, we don't cause<br />
trouble we don't, bother nobody...</p><br />
<br />
<p>And about a half hour later, we were all asleep, even Dennis. So maybe it<br />
worked, after all.</p><br />
<br />
<p>That's the milk story.</p><br />
<br />
<p>how are you feeling, lush?</p></blockquote><br />
