                things you should know about the Obama administration
            </h2>
			<p>For every good thing he does, there are about 10 more things that are downright Bush-y.</p>


<p>Oh Obama, we needed better. What have you to say in defense of your administration?</p>


<p>Did you know, for instance, that they...</p>


<p>...steered hundreds of billions of bail-out dollars to the very people who drove the country into the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, required nothing of these sharks in return, and did almost nothing for ordinary Americans struggling to survive this disaster?</p>


<p>...opposed congressional legislation limiting financial institution incentive pay packages that put the whole global economy at risk?</p>


<p>...opposed legislation allowing shareholders the right to have even a non-binding say on salaries, even though executives took home billions in bonuses last year while their companies were hemorrhaging money so badly they required a trillion bucks in taxpayer bail-out?</p>


<p>...actually threatened Britain, America's closest ally in the world, with withdrawal of intelligence data that could prevent terrorist attacks unless the British government blocked one of its courts from accepting documented evidence of torture at Guantanamo?</p>


<p>...sent droves of Predator-launched missiles into Pakistan - supposedly one of America's allies - killing groups of civilians, even at weddings, thus intensifying hatred toward the United States?</p>


<p>...tried to shut down a charity's illegal-surveillance suit against the government on the basis of a supposed constitutionally-grounded state secrets privilege which would allow the president to kill any legal case before it is even heard?</p>


<p>...undertook a blitz of immigration enforcement without reform of civil rights violations so nasty that one professor of immigration law described the policies as "literally the worst of all worlds"?</p>


<p>...refused to set legally enforceable immigration detention rules covering such basics as health care and legal representation, instead relying on a flawed contractor-based monitoring system?</p>


<p>...pressured a member of Congress to withdraw an amendment that would have ended the military's disastrous "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" regime, simply by defunding it?</p>


<p>...asked a federal court to dismiss a case in which the plaintiffs challenged the discriminatory Defense of Marriage Act, arguing to the court that heterosexual marriage is "the traditional, and universally recognized, version of marriage"?</p>


<p>...dramatically increased the influence of religion in government, directly violating the First Amendment, by lavishly spending federal dollars on "faith-based' programs, and giving religious groups massively increased power and access within the White House to shape policy questions?</p>


<p>...stood by silently, allowing climate legislation to be watered down to nothing, to include generous pollution allowances to coal utilities, and to undermine the EPA's authority to control carbon emissions?</p>


<p>...backed healthcare legislation that did little for the public and actually increased wasteful federal expenditures, while continuing to enrich insurance, medical, hospital and pharmaceutical corporation vampires?</p>


<p>need I say more?</p>
