            </h2>
			<p>This is becoming quite the regular feature. On the heels of showing you the ugly face of mindless dogma-driven religious psycho-babble, we have a great example of mindless dogma-driven political psycho-babble. It all started when a friend posted a short message about the "only sure thing in life is change".</p>


<p>My favorite points:</p>


<p>1 - friend1 who is the right winger vitriol machine by post 5 is already trying to calm herself down. :)</p>


<p>2 - although friend1 never actually links to any source, or even mentions one, by post 8 the original poster has already 'hosted' a debate in the past tense. I guess a debate for FOX people is basically one person screaming and it lasts about 30 seconds.</p>


<p>3 - friend1 has pretty bad spelling and grammar, which is such a pattern for right wing hate spewers (see any comment thread, anywhere) that it bears mention. Thanks for being typical!</p>


<p>4 - 'Let's not confuse "complaining" with the facts' is a non-sequitur. You can still complain about facts, and by the same token, you are by no means forced to complain about untruthful propaganda. But that is probably confusing for our friend1 who seems to think these 'facts' that no one can verify entitle her to turn a little status update into a political dog fight.</p>


<p>5 - Notice how people on the right are always the first to lower the bar. Ok, so I started with a question: "why are you complaining?", which to me is an invitation to discourse, although possibly tainted with a little antagonism. But that's a far cry from 'quit believing what the left-winged media spoons [sic] feeds you and start using the brain that God gave you', which to me is more than a little insulting, pre-supposes a Christian heritage, and is of course a directive (a diplomatic no-no).</p>


<p>6 - friend1 has no more to say at all, if she actually responds I will post again.</p>


<p>7 - Finally, to my mind the real tragedy is that we have plenty of things to be angry at Obama about, and this is not one of them. Just another case of some Texas girl (friend1 is from the Bush state) parroting right-wing propaganda because she likes to be a bitch, <i>just a little bit</i>, with no respect for the Academic tradition of actually 'sourcing' your data. Sheesh.</p>


<p>Anyway, without further ado, here it is:</p>


<hr />


<p>status update by (<b>OP</b>): .......The only sure thing in life is change......</p>


<p><b>friend1</b>: ...and death and taxes. When Obama is done with us we will even be taxed for dying. Good times...</p>


<p><b>me</b>: <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/28418678/the_death_tax_scam" title="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/28418678/the_death_tax_scam">http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/28418678/the_death_tax_scam</a></p>


<p>Estates worth up to $7 million per couple, and $3.5 million for individuals, are already exempt from taxes â€” meaning that 99.75 percent of all Americans die without paying a dime to Uncle Sam.</p>


<p>Are you really worth over $7 million?...</p>


<p>If not, why are you complaining?<br />
If so, why are you complaining?</p>


<p><b>friend2</b>: um, i do believe bush pretty much took care of that.</p>


<p><b>friend1</b>: Ah, yes. What RS and the other liberal media venues fail to mention is that under your president's plan, by 2011, the exemption will be back down to $1,000,000 at a 55% rate. What this means is that when our loved ones die and pass on money, property, businesses, etc., we will have a short time to come up with the tax. If the capital is not readily available, we must start selling off assets to cover said tax. Look at the economy now. The value of land and improvements has severly declined, even though tax records may have the property valued at a much greater rate per previous years. Have you ever heard of "house poor"? This could potentially be far more severe to you and me, meaning we could lose our own personal property in the deal. Uncle Sam waits for no man.<br />
Your boy Obama and his pals Reed and Palosi have an agenda. Quit believing what the left-winged media spoons feeds you and start using the brain that God gave you.<br />
Let's not confuse "complaining" with the facts.</p>


<p><b>friend1</b>:  Oh, and <name>, you said bush...</name></p>


<p>Here's an idea...Let's all do some yoga and CHILL!</p>


<p><b>OP</b>: Exactly!! You have 4 years before you can change that choice!</p>


<p><b>friend2</b>: LOL I just got it <op>. <friend1>, not much up to snuff here on the economic aspects, although I am trying to learn. But I can assure you that even with my current disappointment with this admin I can safely say it is FAR better than what the alternative being offered. Not going to get into it here but if you want, we can have a drink sometime...would loveto hear differing POV's. Academic debate if you will. Love ya...Peace out</friend1></op></p>


<p><b>OP</b>: Death &amp; Taxes were far from my mind.......I was just thinking about your everyday no big deal or maybe some big changes..........</p>


<p><b>friend2</b>: lol. see what a simple thought can produce...you instigator..</p>


<p><b>friend1</b>: I am always up for cocktails and friendly banter. What are you doing these days? <b>OP</b>, thanks for hosting the debate! ; ))</p>


<p><b>friend2</b>: yes <b>OP</b>, thanks for hosting. I have most nights free. just let me know.</p>


<p><b>friend3</b>: funny stuff above. I think <b>friend1</b> needs some yoga!</p>


<p><b>me</b>: Got any 'sources' on that?</p>
