                the case for faith
            </h2>
			<p>Two friends who shall remain nameless had this exchange on Facebook today, and I find it to be priceless.</p>


<p>Here was the question:<br />
<i><br />
A question for my religious friends(all of you, pretty much); Isn't "faith" just a word for "I believe it because I want to"?</i></p>


<p><b>ANSWER:</b></p>


<p>I wouldn't say that belief is only "because I want to" because, at least for me, belief includes a lot of things I wouldn't mind not believing in so it isn't a matter of want. I don't want to believe that hell or the devil exists but I do... there is good stuff I believe too... but with it there is some not so fun stuff. And being Catholic there are sure a lot of sins to avoid (like dodging land mines)</p>


<p>I think the best way to explain it (and it doesn't really explain it at all) is: For those who believe no explanation is necessary and for those who do not no explanation will ever be enough. I believe because I sense a lot of magic in the world and feel that nature/science is so intricate that there is a design... anyway sorry that this was so long... but you asked ;)</p>


<p>...</p>


<p>How's that for articulate! Woohoo, case for faith made. Slam-dunk, baby.</p>


<p>point 1: 'faith' encompasses 'bad' things too, so it can't be 'just because you want to'; i.e., it's such a bitter pill to swallow, it must be a good thing.</p>


<p>point 2: The true 'case' for faith is irrational.</p>


<p>point 3: This darn world is so complicated, it must be holy - i.e., I don't understand science, so there must be a god.</p>


<p>Thanks for playing!</p>


<p>Come back next week, when we make the case for eating one's own poop.</p>


<p>...</p>


<p>p.s. I am a spiritual person and do believe in a sort of 'god', but the idea that is central to Christianity that goes something like 'there is only one true god' is what bothers me. it is this exclusionary principle that allows anti-choicers to shoot 'baby-killers' and a largely Christian US military to shoot up 'all them heretics' without compunction. This is a deeply destructive concept and has no place in the modern world. I see this apparent here in the idea that 'hell and the devil' are real, and this is seen as an 'objective truth' in the eyes of the respondent. This is dangerous because it necessarily divides her from and antagonizes her against other people in the world that decide not to believe in 'hell and the devil'.</p>


<p>Ah, the lazy mind:<br />
<i><br />
The lazy mind will not take the trouble of going to the bottom of anything; but discouraged by the first difficulties, (and every thing worth knowing is attended with some,) stops short, contents itself with easy, and consequently superficial knowledge, and prefers a great degree of ignorance to a small degree of trouble.<br />
</i><br />
