<p>Ah, the old http status code. Very nice. I recently built my first pro-grade web service and had some problems figuring out the status codes. Here are some tips from my friend happyfrenchy2:<br />
<i><br />
Usually I write my rest service so that a problem with the parameters (wrong ID, not enough params, etc) returns a 400 (bad request), a auth failure (wrong signature) returns a 403 (forbidden) and an internal problem (couldn't access DB for instance) returns a 503 (server error). Return code 500 should be when the error happens before your code was even reached (like the server or web-server is down).</i></p>


<p>Very helpful. This is what that looks like, in the create method of the /installs web service:</p>
