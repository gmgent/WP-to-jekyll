<p>So let me get this straight:</p>


<p>Noah is supposed to have had dinosaurs on the ark with him? And Jesus 'rode them'? What? This is what they teach the poor kids that are suckered into having the 'Beginners Bible' coloring book?</p>


<p>That doesn't even remotely make sense. even if the 'Noahs Ark' story were true, which it isn't, the dinosaur was wiped out by the end of the Mesozoic era, which is WAY before the Romans and the 3 Kings and all that. So what's up? Besides that, according to their own chronology, the 'flood' was supposed to be about 4500 years ago, which would be roughly 2500 years before Jesus was born - so he went back in time to ride the dinosaurs?</p>


<p>This just goes to explain why all of the Jesus people are confused. The things they are taught just don't add up. It's like they are trying to build little robots that don't EVER ask questions because they know the answers are not really the point.</p>

<p>Fact: Dinosaurs lived in the Mesozoic era.</p>


<p>The Dinosaurs and many of the other large prehistoric reptiles existed in the Mesozoic era of the Phanerozoic aeon. The Mesozoic era ran from about 250 million years ago to 65 million years ago.</p>

<p>Fact: According to the Biblical chronology the global flood occurred approximately 4500 years ago.</p>


<p>Also funny: the way <a href="http://www.nwcreation.net/noahsark.html" target="_blank">this dude</a> tries to defend the indefensible. This paragraph is the kicker:<br />
<i><br />
According to the Biblical chronology the global flood occurred approximately 4500 years ago. If this event occurred as described in the Bible, the geological evidence left behind could never be correctly interpreted by a naturalist. Although the earth is covered in monumental volumes of sediment, the existence of modern animals atop these deposits must be explained naturally (i.e. many local floods, gradual deposition over millions of years). However, the Bible specifically says that God caused the earth to be flooded until the waters exceeded the highest mountain by 20 feet (Gen 7:20), and to the extent necessary so no human was capable of surviving without supernatural intervention. The evidence of this event covers the entire world, but can not be correctly interpreted by modern science due to their atheistic philosophy and naturalistic presuppositions.<br />

<p>This is why creationists are generally not sought after for their scientific opinions. :)</p>
