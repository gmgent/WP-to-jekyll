<br />
<br />
<p>Yup, as if we were in a bizarro world, Obama just won the Nobel Peace Prize.</p><br />
<br />
<br />
<p>For the first time in a long time, I find myself agreeing with Republicans on this. I just don't feel that he deserves it. Granted, most of my issues with him have to deal with domestic policy, but still there are things that spill over into the world stage that he is responsible for that are antithetic to a 'Peace Prize'.</p><br />
<br />
<br />
<p>1 - Guantanamo is not closed. Furthermore, there is evidence that we are still routinely torturing 'terrorists' and claiming 'state secrets' to avoid investigation. Where's the peace in that?</p><br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<p>2 - We are still in Iraq and Afghanistan. Where's the peace in that?</p><br />
<br />
<br />
<p><a href="http://blog.puppetgov.com/2009/10/09/continuing-wars-in-iraq-and-afghanistan-obama-wins-nobel-peace-prize/" title="http://blog.puppetgov.com/2009/10/09/continuing-wars-in-iraq-and-afghanistan-obama-wins-nobel-peace-prize/">http://blog.puppetgov.com/2009/10/09/continuing-wars-in-iraq-and-afghani...</a></p><br />
<br />
<br />
<p>3 - Obama has made the Israel/Palestine conflict worse, not better, by stocking his cabinet full of AIPAC members without a single Palestinian advocate.</p><br />
<br />
<br />
<p><a href="http://tpmcafe.talkingpointsmemo.com/2009/09/20/steve_walt_aipac_still_thwarting_obama_on_middle_e/" title="http://tpmcafe.talkingpointsmemo.com/2009/09/20/steve_walt_aipac_still_thwarting_obama_on_middle_e/">http://tpmcafe.talkingpointsmemo.com/2009/09/20/steve_walt_aipac_still_t...</a></p><br />

<br />
<br />
<p>4 - Finally, the mistake Obama made to fill all his Finance positions with Goldman Sachs cronies and ex-Bushies was a slap in the face to Progressive movements everywhere. The corporate handouts have been obscene, and the foul play has been absolutely obvious. The fact that Obama (and his hatchet-man Geithner) have papered over the problem (pun intended) as opposed to attacking the source of it is undeniable and shameful. Where, I ask, is the peace in that?</p><br />
<br />
<br />
<p><a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/26793903/the_big_takeover" title="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/26793903/the_big_takeover">http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/26793903/the_big_takeover</a></p><br />
<br />
<br />
<p>The only convincing argument I've heard is that the Nobel committee is trying to 'encourage' Obama to continue in his 'pursuits'. All I can say to that is: don't we do that with children? Give them rewards to 'encourage' them?</p><br />
<br />
<br />
<p>Real adults get rewarded for results, not pursuits. I am saddened by the Nobel committee, and I agree with many bloggers out there - the only honorable thing to do is give it back. He may yet earn it, and I am pulling for him - but it is way too early to give the prize to him now. There were 200+ other names on that list - I guarantee that there were some REALLY deserving names on there that could have used the money and the publicity to push their agenda along. What a monumental loss of an opportunity.</p><br />
<br />
<br />
<p>Ah well - good on ya, Barack, for gaming the system. Here's hoping you live up to what was once a powerful legacy.</p><br />
<br />
<br />
<p>My vote would have gone to Greg Mortenson, or someone like him - currently low-profile, and could use some publicity for a simple and solid mission. </p><br />
