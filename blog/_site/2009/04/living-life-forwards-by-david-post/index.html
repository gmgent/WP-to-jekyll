<p>There's a good reason that generals, as the saying goes, are always fighting the last war. It's the same reason the drunk looks for his lost keys under the streetlight rather than in the dark alley where he actually dropped them: The light's better there. We won't find our keys, and we won't learn how to fight the next war - but what else can we do? It's just as Kierkegaard said - we live forward, but can only understand backward. That's just part of the human condition, the way the world is constructed.</p>
