<p>I stumbled across this ( <a href="http://tech.yahoo.com/blogs/null/116923">http://tech.yahoo.com/blogs/null/116923</a> ) story today, and as is increasingly the case, the comments are far more interesting than the article. It seems that people have very strong opinions about Microsoft and Vista. The general consensus - most people HATE Vista. I am one of those people, not so much because I know too much about it - other than it is a resource hog, is very slow, and was basically conceived of in order to sell more &#039;stuff&#039; - as opposed to meeting any sort of concrete need.</p>


<p>Anyway, here it is in a nutshell - if you want user-friendly, totally reliable, works right out of the box, get a Mac. I couldn&#039;t possibly use anything other than my MacBook Pro for the software development I do. Linux is a relatively close second. Windows is way behind the pack.</p>


<p>So that&#039;s my two cents - Microsoft? Mostly just a piece of sh1t.</p>


<p>I always tell this story at work - basically a few years back I wrote reports for Fox IT and I had to install the whole .NET stack - information server (IS), the .NET platform, and then Reporting Services platform (a branch of Visual Studio). It literally took me a week. After about 6 attempted installs that went wrong for one reason or another - adding patches in wrong order, finding the right MS subscription disc for the newest RS install, wrestling the right admin privileges from the network admins, etc. A whole week.</p>


<p>You can walk into an Apple store, buy a MacBook off the shelf, download the latest Ruby/Rails stack and be up and running by maybe right after lunch time. There is just no comparison. Of course you have to write your own reports (as there is no real reporting platform yet for Rails) but there WILL be, and for now writing reports with rails is already pretty easy.</p>
