<p>I needed to rip an old live dvd from about 5 years ago with an archaic encryption and this little puppy did it - on my Intel MacBook Pro. I also had to buy the <a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/mpeg2/">http://www.apple.com/quicktime/mpeg2/</a> Quicktime encoder. Leave it to QT to fleece you every change they get. The streamclip utility works really well and will allow to you crop video - something QT would be happy to charge you another $30 for (Quicktime &#039;Pro&#039;). Don&#039;t do it. You need the mpeg2 encoder but don&#039;t buy the Quicktime Pro - it is more or less worthless.</p>
