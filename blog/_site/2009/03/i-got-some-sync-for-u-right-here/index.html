<p>Well, this is sort of a test post but it is definitely a think piece. :)</p><br />
<p>It started when I decided to try to start syncing up all of my 'posts'. That led me to Twitter, which then led me to ping.fm, and of course the google reader has been part and parcel of this all along the way.</p><br />
<p>The other piece is my home page at kristeraxel.com, which I use to drive posts and to keep my content under my own umbrella. For example, my sister has a beautiful blog over at blogspot, but I wonder what will ever happen if they go under or get bought, I just hate not having control like that. Ditto for pictures, even video. It kills me that people fall over themselves to hand their content to the Flickrs and the Youtubes of the world, when you can pay like $60 a year to keep all your shit to yourself. Hold on to your content, people! Privacy is a big deal too, but it's the short sightedness that gets me. Is anyone backing anything up, or is this generation literally handing itself over, one anecdotal reference at a time, to big business for prompt monetization and eventual subversion? I can see a future where you have to pay YouTube to give you back a copy of the video you uploaded. They'll call it an 'administration fee', and it will probably be more than the 6 bucks per month or so that you have to pay to get a real host with unlimited storage.</p><br />
<p>But I digress. So here's what is going on:</p><br />
<p>My Drupal site is linked to Twitter. Twitter posts show up here, and posts on my Drupal site (kristeraxel.com) get auto-synopsized into a Twitter post. Cool!<br /><br />
Those Twitter posts feed into my google reader for easy reference.</p><br />
<p>I used to have my Facebook account tied to my google reader feed (stay with me here) so that any article I flag to 'share' will pop up as a micro post in FB; but that didn't work too well because the Notes module had this habit of tying all posts in one day into a single 'omni' post, which was not cool. So now, I have tied my FB notes module to my Twitter feed, and I will see if the Twitter updates that get generated from my Drupal site will shoot all the way through to FB - a man can dream. I'll update more when I know for sure. I also found that most good web sources these days have a direct 'post to facebook' option, which renders the whole 'share through google reader' functionality less necessary.</p><br />
<p>Finally, the kicker is that I can post a status update via ping.fm, and that seems to be able to shoot through to - linkedin, facebook, friendfeed, and Twitter.</p><br />
<p>Friendfeed I only use to bounce stuff into my Vox account via RSS, but Vox won't let me automate it. I only signed up at Vox for an open_id, and it kind of sucks, but friendfeed is pretty good for aggregating last.fm info with fb status stuff, give you that voice of a proletariat. Sheesh. Lastly, my thesixtyone account seems to have some Twitter interfacing abilities, but I am so tired of u/p combos and dev keys that I am probably going to drink a whole bottle of whiskey before dinner.</p><br />
<p>So there you have it. </p><br />
<p>bottom line: Skip Vox, they are not very cool.</p><br />

<p>added comment (Mar 2011): Vox disappeared in late 2009, I believe. I was right about them. :)</p><br />
