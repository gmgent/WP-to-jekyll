<p>I have been archiving incarnations of my personal web site and blog posts since 2005 now, and I am once again shifting gears in my personal engine of feeds and re-posting mechanisms. :)</p>


<p>Tumblr now is my vehicle for blog posts and I'll just copy over the same copy every time I write something. It's not ideal but it will work for now until I find time to automate the re-posts. At the end of the day, I spend way more time writing it than anything else. The reason I like Tumblr is that it will automate the tweets and the Facebook posts, and that saves me a lot of time right there.</p>


<p>When you are in the top million it really makes you want to keep stepping up your game.</p>
