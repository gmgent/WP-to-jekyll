<p>Sample Letters to Support NCEA ACRE in the Field</p>


<p>NCEA ACRE Sample letter to Parents for Individual Student Reports. Used with permission. There will be additional letters forthcoming as permission is granted for them to appear.</p>


<p>December 3, 2001</p>


<p>Dear Parents,</p>


<p>Your Notre Dame senior recently took the ACRE (Assessment of Catechesis Religious Education) survey. ACRE assesses faith knowledge and the affective domains of beliefs, attitudes, practices, and perceptions. Your child's individual results are included with this letter.</p>


<p>These individual results were sent directly to me and are not part of your child's academic file. The individual results will not be seen by any faculty or staff member of the school or Diocese, and will not influence any course grade.</p>


<p>ACRE was administered to seniors in both Diocesan high schools and to all fifth and eighth graders in our elementary schools. There were two purposes to the administration of this survey: to provide students and their parents with an understanding of the student's faith development and to provide the schools with group data. Each school will use the group data (no names indicated) to ascertain strengths and weaknesses in their religion curriculum. In addition, the Office of Catholic Schools will analyze the group data from all schools as part of a needs assessment for curriculum development. The goal is to improve the religious education and the religious experience of each student.</p>


<p>I am very pleased to announce that the group data for Notre Dame students, both Catholic and non-Catholic, is very good. Our students have a firm understanding of their faith. This is due to you, the parents as the primary educators, your church, the elementary schools, and to Notre Dame's teachers. Thank you for all your support.</p>


<p>Sincerely,</p>


<p>Jo Dean Salley, Ph.D.<br />
Principal</p>
