        <title>Sweet Thing from Sky Meet Sea</title>
        <link>2012/10/sweet-thing-from-sky-meet-sea</link>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://kristeraxel.com/media/2012-kristeraxel-SweetThing.mp3&quot;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; (Sweet Thing) is my first single from the new album. I wrote it years ago but it only got produced for Sky Meet Sea so here it is finally. Buy the whole album at &lt;a href=&quot;http://axelradio.com/album/sky-meet-sea&quot;&gt;AxelRadio&lt;/a&gt; for only $4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Produced by Krister Axel, mixed by Scotty Lund. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Somewhere from Sky Meet Sea</title>
        <link>2012/10/somewhere-from-sky-meet-sea</link>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://kristeraxel.com/media/2012-kristeraxel-Somewhere.mp3&quot;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; (Somewhere) was also recorded at the Village Studios in Santa Monica. Love that place. Horn part written by the amazing Bill Dowling. Somewhere - a very simple song that I think was produced beautifully (if I do say so myself).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don't want to be
alone in a storm with me
you don't want to be
lost at sea with me&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you might love me
you might care
you might need me
somewhere&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you don't want to be
chasing stars with me
you don't want to be
hiding your heart from me&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you might love me
you might care
you might need me
somewhere&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;somewhere, somewhere
you might need me somewhere&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Sky Meet Sea album title track</title>
        <link>2012/10/sky-meet-sea-title-track</link>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://kristeraxel.com/media/2012-kristeraxel-SkyMeetSea.mp3&quot;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; (Sky Meet Sea) is the title track from the album. I love how it turned out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Added vocals by Lindsey Harper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I walked through the door
with the wine in my hands
and a smile on my face
like a child
the weekend would fade
but then something would change
and we'd be here
together again&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I waited up
I shined the light
I found the truth
and I made it right&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;there's a place I believe
where the sky meets the sea
where we both can be free to hold on
and this place I can see
where we both need to be
is where the sky meets the sea and holds on
so baby hold on to me
where the sky meets the sea&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this show must go on
because there's nothing so strong
as the force
of a billion desires
we lose everyone
to the bass and the drums
and the voices
that just feed the fire&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I waited up
I shined the light
I found the truth
and I made it right&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;there's a place I believe
where the sky meets the sea
where we both can be free to hold on
and this place I can see
where we both need to be
is where the sky meets the sea and holds on
so baby hold on to me
where the sky meets the sea&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;when I walk through the door
with a hand in my hand
and a kiss from the girl
that I love
we never look back
at the broken down tracks
and the troubles
that we overcome&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;there's a place I believe
where the sky meets the sea
where we both can be free to hold on
so baby hold on
hold on
hold on
hold on to me
where the sky meets the sea&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>All Tied Up from Sky Meet Sea</title>
        <link>2012/10/all-tied-up-from-sky-meet-sea</link>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://kristeraxel.com/media/2012-kristeraxel-AllTiedUp.mp3&quot;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; (All Tied Up) was recorded at THe Village Studios in Santa Monica, what a great session that was. I played all of the instruments except for Scotty added some drums and cajone. My wife loved this song after I assured her it was written about nothing specific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All tied up, nowhere left to go but down
you turn your world around
burning down the house
when everything goes south
you change your state
find a place to go away
and try to love again
choice is not a sin
when someone lets you in
I know you're hurt
I know you're hurt&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we take what's good and we take what's right
we break our toys and don't think twice
we hold our breath and don't know why
but it's over, it's over
has it been so long since the day we were born
because I feel so much is all but gone
so I hold my head I don't look back
but it's over, it's over&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it's over now, it's over now&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All tied up and something in my head won't budge
I'm changing all my ways
I'm counting up the days
the ones we didn't hate
it's over now and so we say again - you're out
and someone else is in
we don't know where they've been
but choice is not a sin&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we take what's good and we take what's right
we break our toys and don't think twice
we hold our breath and don't know why
but it's over, it's over
has it been so long since the day we were born
because I feel so much is all but gone
so I hold my head I don't look back
and it's over, it's over&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it's over now, it's over now
it's over now, it's over now&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Tragic from the Paper Sun days</title>
        <link>2012/10/tragic-from-the-paper-sun-days</link>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://kristeraxel.com/media/2012-kristeraxel-Tragic.mp3&quot;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; (Tragic) is one of the first recordings I ever did in Los Angeles. Those were great days, Sally Jaye and Joel Eckels, Carson Cohen and Adam Marcello, and yours truly. Recorded in 2002 I think.&lt;/p&gt;
