does not exist. As if<br />
the struggle was against nothing<br />
shadows and easy promises<br />
empty air and reflections<br />
but no road to walk on.</p><br />
<br />
<p>this window I have stared through<br />
for a full season of my life<br />
has no purpose. There is nothing to see<br />
on the other side, only<br />
more of the same. It is not<br />
as I imagined.</p><br />
<br />
<p>the only feeling I have<br />
is that of drifting. Along<br />
some corridor in my mind<br />
that leads into soft madness<br />
like a cloud of cotton<br />
behind my nose</p><br />

<br />
<p>When I walked through the door<br />
with the wine in my hands<br />
and a smile on my face<br />
like a child<br />
the weekend would fade<br />
but then something would change<br />
and we'd be here<br />
together again</p><br />
<br />
<p>I waited up<br />
I shined the light<br />
I found the truth<br />
and I made it right</p><br />
<br />
<p>there's a place I believe<br />
where the sky meets the sea<br />
where we both can be free to hold on<br />
and this place I can see<br />
where we both need to be<br />
is where the sky meets the sea and holds on<br />
so baby hold on to me<br />
where the sky meets the sea</p><br />
<br />
<p>this show must go on<br />
because there's nothing so strong<br />
as the force<br />
of a billion desires<br />
we lose everyone<br />
to the bass and the drums<br />
and the voices<br />
that just feed the fire</p><br />
<br />
<p>I waited up<br />
I shined the light<br />

so baby hold on to me<br />
where the sky meets the sea</p><br />
<br />
<p>when I walk through the door<br />
with a hand in my hand<br />
and a kiss from the girl<br />
that I love<br />
we never look back<br />
at the broken down tracks<br />
and the troubles<br />
that we overcome</p><br />
<br />
<p>there's a place I believe<br />

<p>It is possible that <strong>Somewhere</strong> gets by the gatekeeper for admission into the Radio Paradise playlist. That would be groovy. They are notoriously picky, and it is a privately run internet radio so it is up to the opinion of only 2 people. I am by no means approved yet but at least a song is getting reviewed now. The previous 5 were 'sorried' immediately. Oh the cruel whim of whimsy!</p><br />
<br />
<p>Please support <a href="http://www.radioparadise.com/">Radio Paradise</a> because they are awesome.</p><br />

<hr /><br />
<br />
<p>All tied up, nowhere left to go but down<br />
you turn your world around<br />
burning down the house<br />
when everything goes south<br />
you change your state<br />
find a place to go away<br />
and try to love again<br />
choice is not a sin<br />
when someone lets you in<br />
I know you're hurt<br />
I know you're hurt</p><br />
<br />
<p>we take what's good and we take what's right<br />
we break our toys and don't think twice<br />
we hold our breath and don't know why<br />
but it's over, it's over<br />
has it been so long since the day we were born<br />
because I feel so much is all but gone<br />
so I hold my head I don't look back<br />
but it's over, it's over</p><br />
<br />
<p>it's over now, it's over now</p><br />
<br />
<p>All tied up and something in my head won't budge<br />
I'm changing all my ways<br />
I'm counting up the days<br />
the ones we didn't hate<br />
it's over now and so we say again - you're out<br />
and someone else is in<br />
we don't know where they've been<br />
but choice is not a sin</p><br />
<br />
<p>we take what's good and we take what's right<br />

<br />
<blockquote>When we started our small business Facebook was a great way to reach our customers, and stay connected. I gave a lot of credit to it helping us get off the ground. Then things just started changing. We promoted posts for a few months, and it just didn't cut it. The way we sold on FB in the past was by building relationships with our customers…not posting an add. Also those posts adds up FAST!!! At the end of the month it was a nice chunk of money. All the pictures people sent in, and funny ones I posted weren't seen because I can't pay for all of them. Our sales dropped drastically. There are so many pages out there, and budgets are different for everyone. I know that some are paying for every post to be promoted because they are all over my feed. the pages like non-profits, and rescues are no where to be found. I get that FB needs to make money, and I don't mind paying a monthly fee. This isn't working for us, or any of the other small companies I talked with.</blockquote><br />

<p>Sweet Thing</p><br />
<br />
<p>I was the revolution<br />
you were the liberation<br />
that falls from a pregnant sky<br />
set loose on a Friday night<br />
I know what you do to me<br />
you give love in these little pieces<br />
saving for a rainy day<br />
I think you should give it away</p><br />
<br />
<p>Sweet thing, sweet thing<br />
all you get is nothing<br />
sweet thing, sweet thing<br />
all you get is nothing when you put nothing in</p><br />
<br />
<p>she's high on the running away<br />
here tonight and gone the next day<br />
sweet like a candy girl<br />
lasts as long as a dirty word<br />
soft like a butterfly<br />
hot like a brushfire<br />
don't make me fall in love<br />
if you don't want to be the one</p><br />
<br />
<p>Sweet thing, sweet thing<br />
all you get is nothing</p><br />
<br />
<p>Yeah, yeah and you're feeling so much better<br />
you're feeling so much better<br />
Yeah, yeah and you're feeling so much better<br />
you're feeling so much better</p><br />
<br />
<p>Sweet thing, sweet thing<br />
all you get is nothing<br />
sweet thing, sweet thing<br />
all you get is nothing when you put nothing in</p><br />
