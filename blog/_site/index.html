has no purpose. There is nothing to see

<hr />

<p>When I walked through the door
with the wine in my hands
and a smile on my face
like a child
the weekend would fade
but then something would change
and we'd be here
together again</p>

<p>I waited up
I shined the light
I found the truth
and I made it right</p>

<p>there's a place I believe
where the sky meets the sea
where we both can be free to hold on
and this place I can see
where we both need to be
is where the sky meets the sea and holds on
so baby hold on to me
where the sky meets the sea</p>

<p>this show must go on
because there's nothing so strong
as the force
of a billion desires
we lose everyone
to the bass and the drums
and the voices
that just feed the fire</p>

<p>I waited up
I shined the light
I found the truth
and I made it right</p>

<p>there's a place I believe
where the sky meets the sea
where we both can be free to hold on
and this place I can see
where we both need to be
is where the sky meets the sea and holds on
so baby hold on to me
where the sky meets the sea</p>

<p>when I walk through the door
with a hand in my hand
and a kiss from the girl
that I love
we never look back
at the broken down tracks
and the troubles
that we overcome</p>

<p>there's a place I believe
where the sky meets the sea
where we both can be free to hold on
so baby hold on
hold on
hold on
hold on to me
where the sky meets the sea</p>

<p>It is possible that <strong>Somewhere</strong> gets by the gatekeeper for admission into the Radio Paradise playlist. That would be groovy. They are notoriously picky, and it is a privately run internet radio so it is up to the opinion of only 2 people. I am by no means approved yet but at least a song is getting reviewed now. The previous 5 were 'sorried' immediately. Oh the cruel whim of whimsy!</p>

<p>Please support <a href="http://www.radioparadise.com/">Radio Paradise</a> because they are awesome.</p>

<p>All tied up, nowhere left to go but down
you turn your world around
burning down the house
when everything goes south
you change your state
find a place to go away
and try to love again
choice is not a sin
when someone lets you in
I know you're hurt
I know you're hurt</p>

<p>we take what's good and we take what's right
we break our toys and don't think twice
we hold our breath and don't know why
but it's over, it's over
has it been so long since the day we were born
because I feel so much is all but gone
so I hold my head I don't look back
but it's over, it's over</p>

<p>it's over now, it's over now</p>

<p>All tied up and something in my head won't budge
I'm changing all my ways
I'm counting up the days
the ones we didn't hate
it's over now and so we say again - you're out
and someone else is in
we don't know where they've been
but choice is not a sin</p>

<p>we take what's good and we take what's right
we break our toys and don't think twice
we hold our breath and don't know why

<blockquote>When we started our small business Facebook was a great way to reach our customers, and stay connected. I gave a lot of credit to it helping us get off the ground. Then things just started changing. We promoted posts for a few months, and it just didn't cut it. The way we sold on FB in the past was by building relationships with our customers…not posting an add. Also those posts adds up FAST!!! At the end of the month it was a nice chunk of money. All the pictures people sent in, and funny ones I posted weren't seen because I can't pay for all of them. Our sales dropped drastically. There are so many pages out there, and budgets are different for everyone. I know that some are paying for every post to be promoted because they are all over my feed. the pages like non-profits, and rescues are no where to be found. I get that FB needs to make money, and I don't mind paying a monthly fee. This isn't working for us, or any of the other small companies I talked with.</blockquote>
