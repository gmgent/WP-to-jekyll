<p>Added vocals by Lindsey Harper.</p>

<hr />

<p>When I walked through the door
with the wine in my hands
and a smile on my face
like a child
the weekend would fade
but then something would change
and we'd be here
together again</p>

<p>I waited up
I shined the light
I found the truth
and I made it right</p>

<p>there's a place I believe
where the sky meets the sea
where we both can be free to hold on
and this place I can see
where we both need to be
is where the sky meets the sea and holds on
so baby hold on to me
where the sky meets the sea</p>

<p>this show must go on
because there's nothing so strong
as the force
of a billion desires
we lose everyone
to the bass and the drums
and the voices
that just feed the fire</p>

<p>I waited up
I shined the light
I found the truth
and I made it right</p>

<p>there's a place I believe
where the sky meets the sea
where we both can be free to hold on
and this place I can see
where we both need to be
is where the sky meets the sea and holds on
so baby hold on to me
where the sky meets the sea</p>

<p>when I walk through the door
with a hand in my hand
and a kiss from the girl
that I love
we never look back
at the broken down tracks
and the troubles
that we overcome</p>

<p>there's a place I believe
where the sky meets the sea
where we both can be free to hold on
so baby hold on
hold on
hold on
hold on to me
where the sky meets the sea</p>

<p>It is possible that <strong>Somewhere</strong> gets by the gatekeeper for admission into the Radio Paradise playlist. That would be groovy. They are notoriously picky, and it is a privately run internet radio so it is up to the opinion of only 2 people. I am by no means approved yet but at least a song is getting reviewed now. The previous 5 were 'sorried' immediately. Oh the cruel whim of whimsy!</p>

<p>Please support <a href="http://www.radioparadise.com/">Radio Paradise</a> because they are awesome.</p>

<hr />

<p>All tied up, nowhere left to go but down
you turn your world around
burning down the house
when everything goes south
you change your state
find a place to go away
and try to love again
choice is not a sin
when someone lets you in
I know you're hurt
I know you're hurt</p>

<p>we take what's good and we take what's right
we break our toys and don't think twice
we hold our breath and don't know why
but it's over, it's over
has it been so long since the day we were born
because I feel so much is all but gone
so I hold my head I don't look back
but it's over, it's over</p>

<p>it's over now, it's over now</p>

<p>All tied up and something in my head won't budge
I'm changing all my ways
I'm counting up the days
the ones we didn't hate
it's over now and so we say again - you're out
and someone else is in
we don't know where they've been
but choice is not a sin</p>

<p>we take what's good and we take what's right
we break our toys and don't think twice
we hold our breath and don't know why

<blockquote>When we started our small business Facebook was a great way to reach our customers, and stay connected. I gave a lot of credit to it helping us get off the ground. Then things just started changing. We promoted posts for a few months, and it just didn't cut it. The way we sold on FB in the past was by building relationships with our customers…not posting an add. Also those posts adds up FAST!!! At the end of the month it was a nice chunk of money. All the pictures people sent in, and funny ones I posted weren't seen because I can't pay for all of them. Our sales dropped drastically. There are so many pages out there, and budgets are different for everyone. I know that some are paying for every post to be promoted because they are all over my feed. the pages like non-profits, and rescues are no where to be found. I get that FB needs to make money, and I don't mind paying a monthly fee. This isn't working for us, or any of the other small companies I talked with.</blockquote>

<p>Sweet Thing</p>

<p>I was the revolution
you were the liberation
that falls from a pregnant sky
set loose on a Friday night
I know what you do to me
you give love in these little pieces
saving for a rainy day
I think you should give it away</p>

<p>Sweet thing, sweet thing
all you get is nothing
sweet thing, sweet thing
all you get is nothing when you put nothing in</p>

<p>she's high on the running away
here tonight and gone the next day
sweet like a candy girl
lasts as long as a dirty word
soft like a butterfly
hot like a brushfire
don't make me fall in love
if you don't want to be the one</p>

<p>Sweet thing, sweet thing
all you get is nothing</p>

<p>Yeah, yeah and you're feeling so much better
you're feeling so much better
Yeah, yeah and you're feeling so much better
you're feeling so much better</p>

all you get is nothing

				        <p class="teaser_info"><p>I have to say, this is a very interesting and original request. I have an old work acquaintance who contacted me and is putting on a show <em>a la</em> Jackson 5. He is a jazz lover and a detail-oriented person, which is why I think this is worth asking around. Apparently he had two singers already lined up but they didn't show up to practice and just pulled out of the project. The last I heard from him, we met up for a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charnett_Moffett">Charnett Moffett</a> show at the Catalina club, and now he is essentially MDing a show for his children and some family friends. They have been practicing for this show since May and need some vocalists to round out their sound.</p>

<p>He is willing to pay $250 per head, which includes the performance and 2-3 practices. He needs one male and one female singer.</p>

<p>If you are interested <a href="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/contact/">contact me</a> immediately and I will put you in touch with Michael.</p>

<p>Details:</p>

<blockquote>We have  a band with my two sons, Miles (17), Max (5), and friends: Nikole (8),  Caren (21+), Roy (21+), Eric (21+).
Max will be playing Drums, Guitar, and Violin.  Nikole will be singing on three songs (soloing on Lotus Flower). 

The show is primarily an opportunity for my sons to play together, Miles lives in Japan most of the year so they haven't 
had an opportunity to play together before.   Miles has been playing guitar, bass, and piano for about four years. Max
has been playing drums & percussion & violin for about three years and guitar for about two years.

As most of them are instrumentalists, it would be good to have vocalists so the music is much more interesting.

We would have two rehearsals on Sunday August 5th, Sunday August 12, both at 3:00p.m. in Pasadena.
And one rehearsal on Saturday August 18th at 11:00 am (most likely, still TBD).


The website for the August 19th performance is here:

    <a href="http://www.vanguardtheband.com/" title="www.vanguardtheband.com">http://www.vanguardtheband.com/</a> 

The working title of the  band is:  "Vanguard"
We're only expecting one show at this time.
