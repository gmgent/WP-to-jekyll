does not exist. As if
the struggle was against nothing
shadows and easy promises
empty air and reflections
but no road to walk on.</p>

<p>this window I have stared through
for a full season of my life
has no purpose. There is nothing to see
on the other side, only
more of the same. It is not
as I imagined.</p>

<p>the only feeling I have
is that of drifting. Along
some corridor in my mind
that leads into soft madness
like a cloud of cotton
behind my nose</p>

<hr />

<p>When I walked through the door
with the wine in my hands
and a smile on my face
like a child
the weekend would fade
but then something would change
and we'd be here
together again</p>

<p>I waited up
I shined the light
I found the truth
and I made it right</p>

<p>there's a place I believe
where the sky meets the sea
where we both can be free to hold on
and this place I can see
where we both need to be
is where the sky meets the sea and holds on
so baby hold on to me
where the sky meets the sea</p>

<p>this show must go on
because there's nothing so strong
as the force
of a billion desires
we lose everyone
to the bass and the drums
and the voices
that just feed the fire</p>

<p>I waited up
I shined the light
I found the truth
and I made it right</p>

<p>there's a place I believe
where the sky meets the sea
where we both can be free to hold on
and this place I can see
where we both need to be
is where the sky meets the sea and holds on
so baby hold on to me
where the sky meets the sea</p>

<p>when I walk through the door
with a hand in my hand
and a kiss from the girl
that I love
we never look back
at the broken down tracks
and the troubles
that we overcome</p>

<p>there's a place I believe
where the sky meets the sea
where we both can be free to hold on
so baby hold on
hold on
hold on
hold on to me
where the sky meets the sea</p>

<p>It is possible that <strong>Somewhere</strong> gets by the gatekeeper for admission into the Radio Paradise playlist. That would be groovy. They are notoriously picky, and it is a privately run internet radio so it is up to the opinion of only 2 people. I am by no means approved yet but at least a song is getting reviewed now. The previous 5 were 'sorried' immediately. Oh the cruel whim of whimsy!</p>

<p>Please support <a href="http://www.radioparadise.com/">Radio Paradise</a> because they are awesome.</p>

I played all of the instruments except for Scotty added some drums and cajone. My wife loved this song after I assured her it was written about nothing specific.</p>

<hr />

<p>All tied up, nowhere left to go but down
you turn your world around
burning down the house
when everything goes south
you change your state
find a place to go away
and try to love again
choice is not a sin
when someone lets you in
I know you're hurt
I know you're hurt</p>

<p>we take what's good and we take what's right
we break our toys and don't think twice
we hold our breath and don't know why
but it's over, it's over
has it been so long since the day we were born
because I feel so much is all but gone
so I hold my head I don't look back
but it's over, it's over</p>

<p>it's over now, it's over now</p>

<p>All tied up and something in my head won't budge
I'm changing all my ways
I'm counting up the days
the ones we didn't hate
it's over now and so we say again - you're out
and someone else is in
we don't know where they've been
but choice is not a sin</p>

<p>we take what's good and we take what's right
we break our toys and don't think twice
we hold our breath and don't know why
but it's over, it's over
has it been so long since the day we were born
