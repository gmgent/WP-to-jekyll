<p>In a restless dream you come to me
They say that love is blind but I can see
That there's something here, too soon to tell
what it is, what it is, whatever it is - I know it well
but nothing, nothing is for sure</p>

<p>So tell me one more time what you think of me
I want to know again what a lucky day it's been
I try not to think too much but you can still hear the wheels turning
That must be the hopes and the probes returning
but nothing, nothing is for sure</p>

<p>But when I look at you
singing in a cage
Eternally your eyes
put you on a stage
and when you come around
as everyone must do
don't forget about me
because I won't forget about you</p>

<p>The days go by and I don't try to count them
why do people need to know what surrounds them?
I won't ask you questions, and I won't try to know
I won't try to keep you but I won't let you go
and nothing, nothing is for sure</p>

<p>But when I look at you
singing in a cage
Eternally your eyes
put you on a stage
and when you come around
as everyone must do
don't forget about me
because I won't forget about you</p>
