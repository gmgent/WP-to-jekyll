<p>You push me to my mountain
it falls before my eyes
These faces have grown older
this road is filled with lies</p>

<p>I've been watching closely
without going inside
I'm just resting my feet
These prices are too high</p>

<p>Every day is one
every day is one step closer
to the highest place
on this funky roller coaster
but it should be enough
to not want anything too much
except for your sweet touch
and a place to put my stuff</p>

<p>I hear the fires burning
like angels through a door
why do words stay with me
like scratches on the floor?</p>

<p>Every day is one
every day is one step closer
to the highest place
on this funky roller coaster
but it should be enough
to not want anything too much
except for your sweet touch
and a place to put my stuff</p>
