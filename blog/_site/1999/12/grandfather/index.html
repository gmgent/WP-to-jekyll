<p>Some one built this place on top of trash
a hill beside the lake of concrete ash
windows up against the water
silence fell but someone caught her</p>

<p>I'm taking a long way down
sinking my teeth into the ground</p>

<p>Drifting through every working day
I forget what everyone has to say
but it's all right, no one remembers anyway
I went to college but why was that
I'm starting where everyone starts out at
but it's all right, I got a really hip doormat</p>

<p>I should find a place to settle down
sink these worn out teeth into the ground
windows up against the water
silence fell but someone caught her</p>

<p>I'm taking a long way down
sinking my teeth into the ground</p>

<p>I've been waiting for something good
you know what, it takes longer than it should
I guess I'm standing where my grandfather stood
What if nothing could stop me now
I've gone and painted a doorway out
It's natural to follow your instincts down</p>
