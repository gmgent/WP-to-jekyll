<p>This is the first poem I wrote that I am proud of. I was six years and eight months old. It primarily makes me think of two things. One is that I was clearly first a poet - it was my first natural form of expression, along with possibly art but that is so common for kids of that age that it does not seem noteworthy. The fact that I was writing poems at such an early age means that must be my true calling. I was writing poems as early as 1978, and by 1981 I had a certain facility with it. Of course, I was sort of lacking in big concepts but that's why I like this one - it has a remarkable sense of self-awareness and mortality, which is arguably the richest of deep concepts.</p>

<p>Here it is:</p>

<blockquote>When I was One,
I had just begun.
When I was two
I was nearly new.
When I was three
I was hardly me.
When I was Four,
I was not much more.
When I was Five,
I was just alive.
But now I am Six,
I'm as clever as clever
So I think I'll be six
now for ever and ever.</blockquote>

<p>Notice the slightly random sense of capitalization, I was still figuring out the rules. :)</p>

<blockquote>UPDATE: It has come to my attention that the above poem is identical to a poem called "Now We Are Six" by A.A. Milne, so I can't take credit for that one. I'm not sure why I would have copied a poem like that but I am assuming that was actually the assignment, to just copy something. Maybe it was a handwriting challenge. Anyway, that explains why I only got a 'check' (no 'check plus'). the poem was great, but not mine and not all physically written all that well, perhaps hence the average grade. So keep reading below for a few more poems that I did write at that age.

<p>The second thing this makes me think is that I was so lucky to have such a great school system. Looking back through my 'school papers' from those years - thankfully my parents kept it all - I am amazed to find so many poems. I think there are about a hundred poems from the 4 years between 1978 and 1981 - that is crazy to me. Many of them are sort of mundane and not that memorable, but I was finding a style and working it out and it is obvious that it was not just one teacher but most if not all of them that encouraged me to write poems because they could see that I liked doing it. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montessori_method">Montessori</a> school for the win. I really can't overemphasize how that sort of environment helped me become the person that I am.</p>

<p>Here are two more that I enjoy, from just 2 months before my 7th birthday:</p>

<blockquote>Running Moon - March 13 1981

Sometimes when we drive out at night
I see the half moon thin and white.
It runs beside us like a hound
It's there whenever I turn around.
I say, "good moon, come on
good moon. It won't be long
we'll be home soon." And when
we stop there in the sky
the moon stands still
as still as I.

<blockquote>Untitled - April 1 1981

Little snail,
Dreaming you go.
Weather and rose
Is all you know.
Weather and rose
Is all you see
Drinking the dewdrop's
Mystery.
