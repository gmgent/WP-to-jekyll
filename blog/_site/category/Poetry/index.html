has no purpose. There is nothing to see

more of the same. It is not

Ode to a Seagull at the Diver's Cliff in Saint Tropez

To grow wings, and push myself
through the soft pudding that is
air, in smooth slices falling away
to the left where there are mountains
set like the folds of a whale's fat belly

To dive, and glide along the shore
just above the rocks
to strike a fresh path
with every flight
and touch the earth, the way a child
first touches fire...

I have seen men jump, at night they
drag torches with them but cannot
fly the air feeds the flame
and is too thin
to hold them,

they fall like shadows

  - March 1996

			        <p class="teaser_info"><p>I wrote this for my senior Poetry thesis in college quite some time ago. I am happy to have found it, and I have my mother to thank for that. She keeps everything!</p>

<p>This is a 'Canzone', which is a very strict rhyme scheme of five 12-line stanzas, and a closer stanza of 5 lines for a total of 65 lines across 6 stanzas. Every line ends with one of 5 words that you choose very carefully. I took my five from a snippet by my favorite poet <strong>e.e. cummings</strong>.</p>

<em>some or if where
shall breath a new
(silverly rare
goldenly so)
moon,she is you

    - e. e. cummings</em>
</pre>


<pre>
as if we stood nowhere,
time shall breathe
a spell: where
still happens quickly where
thoughts are so rare
and I don't know where
I put me, once where
everything is, somehow so
curious, quiet was (so)
the place where
I met you:
you

were a red falling leaf, you
had veins where
blood boils, hot you
were red you
wouldn't let me breathe
and I had you
dancing, dreaming you
are so beautiful and rare
it is rare
that I dance but with you
dancing is so
easy, I like it so

like a mad waltz... yet so
simple and you -
if love is fast, so
are you (the bullet) and so
am I (the flesh) where
pain can be so
painless, so
blood-happy I breathe
in, I live and breathe
still: so
I am not un-living, which is rare;
quite rare

when life is rare -
why is this so?
if life is rare
then you (rare,
precious you)
are as the white doe: rare
like a soft stone is rare
I want to trace with two fingers where
the air meets your skin, where
the smooth, rare
curve of your throat (your breath)
purrs - you breathe

and the oceans breathe;
a dried-up wave is not as rare
as you my stare crashes breath-
lessly against you, my breath
sits waiting so
quietly... a secret, stolen breath
waiting to breathe
I cannot but wish of you
want of you
waiting to breathe,
in a world where
time stopped counting where

you lead me everywhere
as you have hidden my breath
somewhere: a beauty of skill quite rare
(and seldomly so),
mademoiselle have you

			        <p class="teaser_info"><p>When I was in Poetry school, we had to write a Canzone as part of the senior curriculum. I was just reminiscing about that in my mind and I realized that it is becoming a lost form. Petrarch had a very specific rhyme scheme for a Canzone, and it seems like people are forgetting that. The internets think it is just some loose italian folk poem, or something like that, but I assure you that at least in the school of Creative Writing in Madison in the 90's it was a very hardcore format. Writing a good Petrarchan canzone is like hitting a hole in one - it doesn't happen often and it should be celebrated. One day soon I will dig up the one I wrote for my senior thesis, but for now here is the form salvaged from <a href="http://www.poetrybase.info/forms/000/31.shtml">here</a>.</p>

<pre>
 
Origin:     
Italian

 
Schematic:      
The rhyme scheme is as follows:

abaacaaddaee
eaeebeeccedd
deddaddbbdee
cdcceccaacbb
bcbbdbbeebaa
aedcb
 
Rhythm/Stanza Length:       
12

 
Line/Poem Length:       
65

</pre>


<p>UPDATE: I found the canzone I wrote, view it <a href="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/2012/07/mademoiselle-de-la-dance/">here</a>.</p>

<p>if I could paint my heart for you right now
the colors would blind us both
 I am in mid-explosion and I can't help it
 afraid to push open the door to this new understanding 
Only now do I realize how far I have wandered
 what it will take to bring me back</p>

<p>  I am glad for you, such a beautiful image
 of young and deliberate passion
 time has not allowed you much failure 
that cleansing fire of regret
 your heart is as big as any canyon
 even as my feet begin to slip</p>

<p>if I could paint my heart for you
 an empty shell is all you would see
 Choosing from among these pretty cages
 I find strength because you are still so free
 I am in mid-explosion and I can't help it
 you are a flower blooming patiently</p>

They left behind that dirty smile you've got<br />
Younger than your timeless ways<br />
Your yesterdays<br />
I know all your tricks<br />
I know the way your heart can hurt like this<br />
I hate the way my plan can miss like this<br />
But there's no changing what my future is<br />
I know all your tricks</p>

And I could see what was coming along<br />
Everybody knew the way to get home, but me<br />
All I needed was<br />
All I needed was a dream</p>

I race<br />
if there&#039;s nothing in this world<br />
you put something in the dirt<br />
and rain on me</p>

			        <p class="teaser_info"><p>All tied up<br />
Nowhere left to go but down<br />
Turn your world around<br />
Burning down the house<br />
when everything goes south<br />
Change your state<br />
Find a place to go away<br />
Try to love again<br />
Choice is not a sin<br />
Try to let me in</p>


<p>I know you're hurt<br />
I know you're hurt</p>


<p>We take what's good and we take what's right<br />
We break our toys and don't think twice<br />
We hold our breath and we don't know why<br />
Now it's over<br />
it's over<br />
has it changed so much since the day we were born?<br />
Because I feel so much is all but gone<br />
So I hold my breath and I don't look back<br />
Now it's over<br />
it's over<br />
it's over now</p>


<p>All tied up<br />
Something in my head won't budge<br />
I'm changing all my ways<br />
Counting up the days<br />
The ones we didn't hate<br />
It's over now<br />
And so we say again<br />
You're out and someone else is in<br />
We don't know where they've been<br />
But choice is not a sin</p>

			        <p class="teaser_info"><p>I thought to buy you a trinket<br />
to express the warmth in my heart for you.<br />
Some small token that might find a home<br />
next to your bed.<br />
There were toys, lawn-gnomes<br />
and rocking chairs<br />
swaying in the cold April wind.<br />
This life falls short of you<br />
in my fleeting paradise beneath the spotlight<br />
I remain incomplete. There is more<br />
to my dream than was planned<br />
I did not mean to love you<br />
without my kingdom in place<br />
I have no control.<br />
Not over this grey morning<br />
or the way the sun shines<br />
not over my heart<br />
which knows only your name<br />
I found nothing to offer you but myself<br />
and this handful of rain<br />
tears from the Kansas City sky<br />
symbols of a love<br />
eternal</p>

<p>&#039;Lavinia, Lavinia, Lavinia, Howsoever Beatest Thine Heart Among the Divinities Shall Ye Be Remembered, Lavinia&#039;</p>

where dreams die and take shape<br />
where highways are twisted at the throat<br />
of the green that once was<br />
sometimes with more choice<br />
comes less freedom<br />
more sugar in place of food<br />
sirens for a handshake<br />
bright lights casting longer shadows<br />
soon the earth will erupt<br />
and reshape the landscapes<br />
in her likeness<br />
to invade the invaders<br />
with mountains for fingers<br />
she brushes the cities<br />
from her brow. As if<br />
to invent a simple fabric<br />
between God and Man<br />
she turns over<br />
her bed</p>

you left me where I couldn't cross<br />
grateful for my piece of sunshine<br />
but knowing how much more is lost.<br />
Everyone comes up together<br />
everyone goes down alone<br />
with half a life to run away<br />
and barely time to find a home.<br />
Somehow we have made our peace<br />
dodging the forms of our skeptic souls<br />
I think tonight no one will bleed<br />
and then perhaps no one grows old.<br />
With simple words we scale a sonnet<br />
balanced, all our hopes upon it.</p>

With opinions about my state<br />
Staying up late</p>


<p>I don't know where I am<br />
This voice beneath the hum<br />
I spend my nights alone with words<br />
The echo of a drum<br />
I love the way we talk<br />
This language of the soul</p>


<p>I want to thank you for saying my name</p>


<p>Some thirst for perfection<br />
guides my days. Like noise<br />
in long breaths of scented smoke<br />
the poison of poetic lust<br />
grows in my blood like a weed<br />
I accept this. Every hour<br />
Pushing with what strength I have<br />
Against yesterday</p>


<p>Where once was a child is now<br />
A fool. He follows heat<br />
And questions what is fire<br />
I am this champion of doubt<br />
Against what can't be named<br />
I accept this. With my words<br />
Construction of simple color<br />
The unknown voice</p>


<p>Never seen. Decides what is real</p>


<p>And the sad eyes of exhaustion<br />
ever wise. In this life will be</p>

Perched beside a campfire<br />
Breathing in the stars<br />

A lover's rage and a lonesome hunger<br />
My true north and my blessings<br />
Contented for now<br />
And the flow of these images<br />
Spirals of patience and love<br />
As I drag my possessions behind me<br />
Scraps of mortar and blood</p>


<p>I build myself a landscape<br />
In the image of your grace<br />
Asleep in the arms of innocence<br />
A dream plays across your face</p>


<p>When the smoke has lifted<br />
And the sun never again forgets to shine<br />
Let us both remember such places<br />
A thoughtful summer not quite wasted<br />
Waiting for the lights to change<br />
For one color to bleed into another<br />
For the fuel to catch the flame<br />
May nothing remain the same<br />
Not quite yesterday<br />
And never tomorrow<br />
This nest of sorrows past<br />
Of heaven misplaced</p>


<p>Asleep in the arms of desire<br />
A dream plays across your face</p>

From some ancient place

Cold to the touch, yet
Hot like a black stove

the walls of my heart are scoured clean
I feel the seasons
raw and hungry for completion
the world is patient
I am frantic in my lust
for a perfect diamond
some piece of god that I can touch</p>

<p>Again, time is quiet
Motionless. I watch young winter
Clutter the seasons
Cold footsteps
Across this checkered floor
It is not enough to bleed
As it once was
Life is no longer priceless
And the wave of dull destiny
Will be taller than the sky
When it comes.</p>

<p>I have cold stones in my heart
And the color of desire
Is dark against the night
As the lights in Hollywood flicker
Eyes opened and shut
This is the fuel of the city
Burning innocence.
As if tomorrow
Was not paid for with the
Red faces of children
I have dragged my net
Across the deep</p>

<p>As good as love
As I swallow fire
Pray for me
That I may sleep</p>

<p>I have wondered at the gray sky
At the cycles of deceit
And the shattering of mirrors…
Is it enough to taste the salt of the ocean
Like some love poem
From across the world?
Even as my own dreams run slowly
Beneath this printed sunset
They begin to die. This formula
Is not good science. This city has forgotten
Itself. The winter rains
The Mississippi, front porches
The path beyond the self
With fire and plastic
Replacing the mosquitoes.
I opened my veins
Blood is life is progress
And this cluttered slope feels
Like a prison
Like a woman's flesh
A mountain of sugar
A long shortcut</p>

<p>I woke up today and my voice was
Older than my heart
Which carries a new scar
The image of a better place.
Let me see the earth dressed
For the seasons.
Let me see passion
In the spectrum of time
We replace the impossible
With the same wicked fever
That has burned heaven
to the ground.
Tonight I watch angels
Illuminate the sky</p>

a symphony in passing cars<br />

<p>Rachel
Your name stops time dead
In it's tracks I know what it's like to be
Alone with human frailty
October like a bruise on your chin
I summon the specter of poetry
The phoenix
Burning
Born with an arrow in its wings
This is the path
And you have not risen
Yet. All is torn
From conflict and happiness
Hurts, it makes no pattern
You give life to the rain
So it might come back with
Answers attached
Waiting for love
As if you didn't know where to look.</p>

<p>We stumble through the future
Some of us with magic
In our fingertips
Some with bitter dust
On cracked lips
Everywhere this motion
Blind speed
Rinse
Repeat
Rinse
Repeat</p>

from today. To see changes<br />

And what<br />
of the paths we dig<br />
in the earth, sinking<br />
every day<br />
to our knees with habit<br />
carved into our faces?<br />
We were born to love<br />
to cry<br />

of circumstance</p>


<p>today we make the promises<br />
tomorrow we keep them</p>

Your heart<br />
Burning next to me</p>

Here we are again<br />
Fireflies<br />
Lighting up the fence<br />
You spin<br />
Further into me<br />
We're at the end</p>


<p>I've waited here for someone<br />
Who peels herself an onion<br />
With the hand of patience<br />
If I stand in your favor<br />
It's a gift I'll open later<br />
Like a flame burning backwards</p>

something about an exit seems so
unbroken so deep so explosive
and we are only at the window
cheeks pressed against the glass
in wait for this freedom so
pale so tired so unsatisfying
when everything seems empty
and the mirror draws blood
I am lost in these mental boxes
the labyrinth of dull desire
and I am with you on this gentle slope
the slow motion of small disaster
this is only a physical distance
remember that we smile at the same sun
there is no peace here that I did not
raise from chaos I imagine
it is the same for you</p>

You've hidden your freedom<br />
Beneath your desire<br />
The known, the unknown<br />
You have opened up this river<br />
Flowing between love and fear<br />
The answer is that you are blessed<br />
And no one knows better than you<br />
How to build heaven<br />
Do not insult the world<br />
with apologies - the beauty of your<br />
heart never sleeps. Trust<br />
that your voice carries strength<br />
that your decisions are right<br />
because you made them. You<br />
will be loved<br />
as you are now<br />
as you were then<br />
because destiny makes no mistake<br />
you cannot hide from yourself<br />
any more than you can run away<br />
be glad for that precious pain<br />
there is poetry under your skin;<br />
you are aware<br />
of the human tragedy - that we fall<br />
madly through time<br />
towards death<br />
and truth<br />
in the span of 30,000 sunsets<br />
with only love to guide us</p>


<p>how sad<br />
and exquisite</p>

Without shadow and eclipse<br />
In small motions, followed<br />
Through these cracks<br />
As the foundations grow weak<br />
Like tired children<br />
Blue is the color of hope<br />
Washing her blue hair<br />
In blue water</p>


<p>If you are lost then follow choice<br />
Through the forest of change<br />
No longer afraid of understanding<br />
Yourself. Of all gifts<br />
You are life, splendid and frail<br />
Dressed in the friendship of strangers<br />
Without the burden of time<br />
Alone by the river<br />
Of blue water</p>

The human satellites<br />
The race of love against momentum<br />
My own skin warm from the memory<br />
Of union. Let no one seek<br />
To cover this unborn flower<br />
Cradled in the soft earth<br />
I dream this without madness<br />
Leaned against the echoing wall<br />
Where a whisper is united<br />
With power and substance<br />
Kings of modern freedom<br />
These messengers shall be</p>

A new world from nothing,<br />
This whisper of a song.</p>

Maybe I imagined this voice<br />
That cannot speak.</p>


<p>I love that you are from Brooklyn, I<br />
Would say to her. I had already found<br />
Poetry in you, like<br />
A current of gold</p>

A wet mask held in place<br />

Some other system of faith<br />
Help me remember the way<br />
That I saw this cold rain<br />
As falling jewels<br />
Littering the sky<br />
And in my troubled sleep<br />
I am a witness to the morning<br />
Bright fingers around the earth<br />
The science of summer<br />
Alone in the mind's eye<br />
Balanced on crutches of fire<br />
It feeds me this bitter rum<br />
Poured over my pale body<br />
Like silver ghosts<br />
The proud new day<br />
Born without knowledge<br />
Of love or misery</p>

I always made mistakes<br />
Forgive me. Truth be told<br />
I have been weak for some time<br />
But you know this. We believed each other<br />
And it was beautiful<br />
Until the weight of my own darkness<br />
Touched your shoulder. Silence<br />
For me is passion<br />
Passion for me is<br />
When you come<br />
I wish a thousand blessings on you<br />
For not hesitating<br />
For bringing me closer<br />
All I have to offer<br />
Are the moments not<br />
Forgotten. I am empty<br />
As I was. Drowning<br />
like a dumb puppy. </p>


<p>I don't know how to be touched</p>


<p>Forgive me.</p>




<blockquote><small>The previous was an apology to a girlfriend who deserved better.

Next is her exceptional reply:</small></blockquote>


<p>Temporary</p>

<p>So he said he runs away even from the good things
Well now, I run full force ahead into them
Knocking them down with my brashness
When they eventually recover from their temporary
concussions
They look at me and say- who are you? and how did
you get here?</p>

<p>I think you will say that eventually
I came at you like a man
But now I want to be a girl
She said you have to stay the same
I can't change
Oh horrid consistency</p>

<p>You are a good thing, I think
But I don't know if I am blinded by your chords
Or that feeling of wanting to covet or possess the
truth you harmonize
Do I just want a piece? Do I just want to be
inspired?
To be in the presence of a force
To know that for a moment when the lights are low
and the flame burns
high
That you are mine-to touch, to breathe in, to hold
Briefly</p>

<p>In a city of the lost and found
I smiled
And you smiled back
For a time I found you
But in the pit of my stomach I have the creeping
sensation of loss
The echo chamber, the tug on the sleeve, the tap on
the shoulder
I can't hit snooze</p>

<p>So I will tell you about myself
I will make the fatal error of maxim exposure
I will smile and bat my eyes and
Hope that you don't make me sorry</p>

			        <p class="teaser_info"><p>The art within myself
Not myself within the art
Good advice
When all there is to this game:
Passion and reason
North and south.
You speak so fluidly
Every word like saltwater
rising from the break
The air bristling with it.
And I am enclosed within this
Letter, just a notion of sweet
release, a blessing for you.
Tomorrow looms large
Like a glass tower and I will climb
Those fragile steps without care.
Looking out across rooftops
And clouds of bitter chalk
Drop my senses and watch them
Fall (as if from the heavens).
The essence of my path
Has been chaos, and I would very grimly
Speak of discipline
And sacrifice were it not
for the burden of truth.
If there has ever been
A home for my heartspeak
It is this symbol of infinity
That I cannot see.</p>

<p>Carry me, for one day
Beautiful chaos
Color the sky with a whim
Anywhere there is motion
Is a good place to begin</p>

<p>Maybe I should write another poem
Maybe I should drink some more poison
Maybe there's no difference between love and
frustration</p>

<p>Maybe I haven't wasted anything
It seems so sudden, this shift
This earthquake. But the sky was dark for months</p>

<p>And where do I find peace, now?
Which way to something better, forgiveness
I hate myself for being your victim</p>

<p>I still fantasize about your body but
Now I have nightmares about your friendship
About the words you never could say</p>

<p>If you love me, you still don't know why
And it doesn't make you happy
So why should it matter?</p>

<p>If I told you how many times I've said
To myself: "You aren't going to call her ever again,
unless..."
You wouldn't believe it</p>

<p>Unless this, or that - if you'd call by Friday
If you fucked me well, blew me whatever
Unless nothing is the logical end</p>

<p>I feel no more pain, I should thank you
For that but I won't
I've been numb for a month now</p>

<p>If I could have it all again
All the time I should have spent
Instead of wasting it on love</p>

<p>like I didn't have enough</p>

<p>I knew in San Francisco, you took your dog
And left me on the phone with Reception
"I will be alone tonight, in fact..."</p>

<p>I can't be let down anymore
I can't love you like this, anymore
You chose your path
I am choosing mine
I choose no more disappointment
A dusty road in August
Away from Ohio
Tell your mother you lost a friend
Somewhere in West Hollywood</p>

<p>Goodbye</p>

and be alone together
this is no wasteland, more
sex for all and all for sex
when secrets are not hidden
they need not be kept</p>

<p>I have not fallen, or made
sour any glances no false
words have crept from these lips
(that once embraced
your waist)
the memory of taste</p>

<p>The infinite Once, no more
no less than enough
if taste lingers well
then loss lingers too much;
one finger from a handshake
some fraction of an earthquake</p>

<p>Your taste, half sweet grace
a soft exquisite place
a bullet through flesh
fine feminine mesh. I
cherish the scars, tracing
your cheek among stars</p>

<p>And the sweep of your hip
the parade of senses - arrested
lost in the curve of your lips
losing a battle against them
the average day eclipsed
by the sugar of your skin</p>

<p>The infinite Once, so perfectly
begun. Such force of attraction
between bodies in motion
such gravity
such careless velocity
of casual emotion.</p>

<p>You are a sky among oceans
a belief among notions
such a deep silhouette
and delicious half-poison -
bringing death back to life
bringing dull to explosion</p>

plus ca change plus c'est la meme chose</p>

<p>The world that we live in
it's a thousand different colors
it's the infinite lover
the mother of mothers
The world that we live in
it's a thousand shades of grey
every word I didn't say
every gift that no one gave</p>

<p>The world that we live in
is bigger than a coffee cup
and it won't get filled up
if the spiders eat their young</p>

<p><small>These are really old lyrics but now they sort of feel like a poem.</small></p>

The fangs of necessity at throat
And your majesty of illusion which
Makes me bow. If fragility is a crime
It is yours, exquisitely - if
Passion is your dream then let us
Walk together, sleeping and
Growing not old. Too much
is a word from your lips, and sometimes
Too little. There are reasons for
No reason and lies painting truth about
Ecstasy remembered and loveless projection
And where are you, where am I when
Time inches past and pain is only dull;
When money like water puddles in the sun
And the heat is a rough hand pushing?
I am next to your skin with my teeth
Beneath the flower of your pride
With my palms at your weak side
At arms to your defense.</p>

<p>Be it for you that I am invisible
Be it your name that holds thick pleasure
For this soldier at peace.
Be it unspoken the conversation,
And unwritten the pact that
Brings my food to your table and
your fingers to my cheek, your words
to my canvas and if I regret
again, as I did being lost, it will be that
I wasn't lost with you
Sooner. Because this is a shadow fallen,
We are a wooden floor together, uncracked</p>

<p>There is nothing else</p>

			        <p class="teaser_info"><p>Love is a sad word sometimes
With memories attached
Like stars in the sky. Yours
Is a galaxy, behind the curtain
Of everyday thoughts. Deep
Affectionate scars on the cheek
Of a universe. I have never
Lost hope this way, this world
Has never been so removed. I am losing
The fight that was to be my last.
And you, still perfect
The way the past can be perfect
Unspoiled the way beauty
Remains. There are no happy
Secrets with me now. My exit
Was no secret, my loss is nothing
Of a secret. I am learning of myself
humanity, destiny
But not of love. Time's fingers
Have pushed me away from
What I remember and there is but
Madness. But I am halfway to nowhere
And despite your enchanting presence
There is no path from here to reach you.</p>

<p>Let no one say that I fell into this grave
Let them see that I dug it first.</p>

<p> So between the days I reach to you,
Your eyes are still with me. And behind
The hours of work that we share, empty
Responsible and serious
I know that I would bring pleasure to you
For lunch. In a letter
Or with powerful thoughts. But there are
Long highways sprawling between us,
And my body is stuck
Between the beach and the mountains
Between strength and forgiveness
Between love and true love.
At a time where life is mostly
Time-lined stressed and blind
sweet bitter broken
and fixed, I lose vision
and sometimes hope. That maybe
better is tomorrow, and again
unbroken are you as
I wish. May the autumn moon
Shine on better days to come,
Your foolish once lover
Is not yet home</p>

stopped the car and put my ego down
took a walk and a look around
I found what I was looking for
Everybody wants to be a star

If it was a gift you would take it</p>

<p>Survival is the only teacher
whiskey's good but love is sweeter
I'm on time when I go to meet her
and I try to bring a gift
No one wants to go unwanted
No one starts to not get started
If you've been in love you've been broken-hearted
but time keeps on picking up speed
and we learn from the ways we bleed</p>

<p>I've been down and out and sometimes sour
but I got skills and I got power
ther's a sucker born every hour

so it's not so bad</p>

<p>I spent time in the handout line
I washed dishes for some fucked up guy
I stole bread and kisses and bottles of wine
but that don't matter to me now
because I'm alive and well somehow</p>

<p>I should not
listen so well
or remember the emotion
at the expense of detail. I
had been told such wonderful things
about my perfect illusion that
I also thought it was no different.
My strengths are beginning to
become weaknesses,
liabilites. Unplanned explanations
And I have nowhere to turn
except inward. Again
retreat, apology again
selfish martyrdom
again aggressive surrender.
I have such pride
in small things and large
feelings, giant
shadows and short friendships
vast oceans of recycled bitterness
and I spit all day red reasons,
blood-red spirit
that never flies. I asked for
everything here
I dreamed of the hope
that would greet me like a mother
greets a newborn and I
found traces
Nothing more. So if I
speak painfully and if
my truth doesn't fit you
If you cannot understand my words
then read your book. And
the insult is your creation
because honesty should never be
qualified. I
apologize for my soul
and love is embittered, I break
my stride and love falls
I follow your whim
and love is trivialized. So
we can make a new pact and
you can ponder petty victory
because my need is greater,
and because you have a woman's army
but you have lost the
unretrieveable. My heart
no longer burns with your image.
It grows cold</p>

This was copied from my book - in 1991 which was my first year in college. It can be seen as a sort of poetic exercise. I was at the time (and still am) enamored of E.E.

Imagine 4 books full with poems like this written in the first 2 years of college, and you can see how I finally came to understand myself through poetry. I forced myself to write a poem every night before bed, whatever the circumstances.

<p>If I am arrogant so be it
I'm too poor for presents
But I'll make it worth your while</p>

<p>A thousand faces are mirrored
Here, in an absent type
Of company
A tethered slave, is fighting
Now, for his right
To be free.
Their eyes are cold,
And pitiful
As they watch for some important
Shame, they treat life as a
Mystery, and not -
As they should -
Like a game.
Hypnosis.
All is one, I
Being, I
Am within that one
Which makes that one
Me.
All these faces
Are laughing - they are
Mine. Or
Parts (of me)
At themselves.
The Gaping Mouth will eat you
Now - is better than
Waiting (I hate having to
Wait. That your neck is
Exposed - not your mix
Of breed (we just like
Would probably just cut it off
At the jugular
To suck like crabs legs
And suck
Or any other armored sea food.
I like it when
Kcrk, khrck
They crunch. It's all in
The preparation / like a good
Crouton.
A mixed, tossed, lively little
Salad of souls with your
Choice of greek</p>

			        <p class="teaser_info"><p>This is the first poem I wrote that I am proud of. I was six years and eight months old. It primarily makes me think of two things. One is that I was clearly first a poet - it was my first natural form of expression, along with possibly art but that is so common for kids of that age that it does not seem noteworthy. The fact that I was writing poems at such an early age means that must be my true calling. I was writing poems as early as 1978, and by 1981 I had a certain facility with it. Of course, I was sort of lacking in big concepts but that's why I like this one - it has a remarkable sense of self-awareness and mortality, which is arguably the richest of deep concepts.</p>

<p>Here it is:</p>

<blockquote>When I was One,
I had just begun.
When I was two
I was nearly new.
When I was three
I was hardly me.
When I was Four,
I was not much more.
When I was Five,
I was just alive.
But now I am Six,
I'm as clever as clever
So I think I'll be six
now for ever and ever.</blockquote>

<p>Notice the slightly random sense of capitalization, I was still figuring out the rules. :)</p>

<blockquote>UPDATE: It has come to my attention that the above poem is identical to a poem called "Now We Are Six" by A.A. Milne, so I can't take credit for that one. I'm not sure why I would have copied a poem like that but I am assuming that was actually the assignment, to just copy something. Maybe it was a handwriting challenge. Anyway, that explains why I only got a 'check' (no 'check plus'). the poem was great, but not mine and not all physically written all that well, perhaps hence the average grade. So keep reading below for a few more poems that I did write at that age.

<p>The second thing this makes me think is that I was so lucky to have such a great school system. Looking back through my 'school papers' from those years - thankfully my parents kept it all - I am amazed to find so many poems. I think there are about a hundred poems from the 4 years between 1978 and 1981 - that is crazy to me. Many of them are sort of mundane and not that memorable, but I was finding a style and working it out and it is obvious that it was not just one teacher but most if not all of them that encouraged me to write poems because they could see that I liked doing it. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montessori_method">Montessori</a> school for the win. I really can't overemphasize how that sort of environment helped me become the person that I am.</p>

<p>Here are two more that I enjoy, from just 2 months before my 7th birthday:</p>

<blockquote>Running Moon - March 13 1981

Sometimes when we drive out at night
I see the half moon thin and white.
It runs beside us like a hound
It's there whenever I turn around.
I say, "good moon, come on
good moon. It won't be long
we'll be home soon." And when
we stop there in the sky
the moon stands still
as still as I.

<blockquote>Untitled - April 1 1981

Little snail,
Dreaming you go.
Weather and rose
Is all you know.
Weather and rose
Is all you see
Drinking the dewdrop's
Mystery.
