Ode to a Seagull at the Diver's Cliff in Saint Tropez<br />
<br />
To grow wings, and push myself<br />
through the soft pudding that is<br />
air, in smooth slices falling away<br />
to the left where there are mountains<br />
set like the folds of a whale's fat belly<br />
<br />
To dive, and glide along the shore<br />
just above the rocks<br />
to strike a fresh path<br />
with every flight<br />
and touch the earth, the way a child<br />
first touches fire...<br />
<br />
I have seen men jump, at night they<br />
drag torches with them but cannot<br />
fly the air feeds the flame<br />
and is too thin<br />
to hold them,<br />
<br />
they fall like shadows<br />

<p>This is a 'Canzone', which is a very strict rhyme scheme of five 12-line stanzas, and a closer stanza of 5 lines for a total of 65 lines across 6 stanzas. Every line ends with one of 5 words that you choose very carefully. I took my five from a snippet by my favorite poet <strong>e.e. cummings</strong>.</p><br />

I put me, once where<br />
everything is, somehow so<br />
curious, quiet was (so)<br />
the place where<br />
I met you:<br />
you<br />
<br />
were a red falling leaf, you<br />
had veins where<br />
blood boils, hot you<br />
were red you<br />
wouldn't let me breathe<br />

dancing, dreaming you<br />
are so beautiful and rare<br />
it is rare<br />
that I dance but with you<br />
dancing is so<br />
easy, I like it so<br />
<br />
like a mad waltz... yet so<br />
simple and you -<br />
if love is fast, so<br />
are you (the bullet) and so<br />
am I (the flesh) where<br />
pain can be so<br />
painless, so<br />
blood-happy I breathe<br />
in, I live and breathe<br />
still: so<br />
I am not un-living, which is rare;<br />
quite rare<br />

when life is rare -<br />
why is this so?<br />
if life is rare<br />
then you (rare,<br />
precious you)<br />
are as the white doe: rare<br />
like a soft stone is rare<br />
I want to trace with two fingers where<br />
the air meets your skin, where<br />
the smooth, rare<br />
curve of your throat (your breath)<br />
purrs - you breathe<br />
<br />
and the oceans breathe;<br />
a dried-up wave is not as rare<br />
as you my stare crashes breath-<br />
lessly against you, my breath<br />
sits waiting so<br />
quietly... a secret, stolen breath<br />
waiting to breathe<br />
I cannot but wish of you<br />
want of you<br />
waiting to breathe,<br />
in a world where<br />
time stopped counting where<br />
<br />
you lead me everywhere<br />
as you have hidden my breath<br />
somewhere: a beauty of skill quite rare<br />
(and seldomly so),<br />
mademoiselle have you<br />

			        <p class="teaser_info"><p>When I was in Poetry school, we had to write a Canzone as part of the senior curriculum. I was just reminiscing about that in my mind and I realized that it is becoming a lost form. Petrarch had a very specific rhyme scheme for a Canzone, and it seems like people are forgetting that. The internets think it is just some loose italian folk poem, or something like that, but I assure you that at least in the school of Creative Writing in Madison in the 90's it was a very hardcore format. Writing a good Petrarchan canzone is like hitting a hole in one - it doesn't happen often and it should be celebrated. One day soon I will dig up the one I wrote for my senior thesis, but for now here is the form salvaged from <a href="http://www.poetrybase.info/forms/000/31.shtml">here</a>.</p><br />
<br />
<pre><br />
 <br />
Origin:     <br />
Italian<br />
<br />
 <br />
Schematic:      <br />
The rhyme scheme is as follows:<br />
<br />
abaacaaddaee<br />
eaeebeeccedd<br />
deddaddbbdee<br />
cdcceccaacbb<br />
bcbbdbbeebaa<br />
aedcb<br />
 <br />
Rhythm/Stanza Length:       <br />
12<br />
<br />
 <br />
Line/Poem Length:       <br />
65<br />
<br />
</pre><br />
<br />
<br />
<p>UPDATE: I found the canzone I wrote, view it <a href="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/2012/07/mademoiselle-de-la-dance/">here</a>.</p><br />

They left behind that dirty smile you've got<br /><br />
Younger than your timeless ways<br /><br />
Your yesterdays<br /><br />
I know all your tricks<br /><br />
I know the way your heart can hurt like this<br /><br />
I hate the way my plan can miss like this<br /><br />
But there's no changing what my future is<br /><br />
I know all your tricks</p><br />

<p>When I was ahead of it all<br /><br />
And I could see what was coming along<br /><br />
Everybody knew the way to get home, but me<br /><br />

All I needed was a dream</p><br />

Nowhere left to go but down<br /><br />
Turn your world around<br /><br />
Burning down the house<br /><br />
when everything goes south<br /><br />
Change your state<br /><br />
Find a place to go away<br /><br />
Try to love again<br /><br />
Choice is not a sin<br /><br />
Try to let me in</p><br />
<br />
<br />
<p>I know you're hurt<br /><br />
I know you're hurt</p><br />
<br />
<br />
<p>We take what's good and we take what's right<br /><br />
We break our toys and don't think twice<br /><br />
We hold our breath and we don't know why<br /><br />
Now it's over<br /><br />
it's over<br /><br />
has it changed so much since the day we were born?<br /><br />
Because I feel so much is all but gone<br /><br />
So I hold my breath and I don't look back<br /><br />
Now it's over<br /><br />
it's over<br /><br />
it's over now</p><br />
<br />
<br />
<p>All tied up<br /><br />
Something in my head won't budge<br /><br />
I'm changing all my ways<br /><br />
Counting up the days<br /><br />
The ones we didn't hate<br /><br />
It's over now<br /><br />
And so we say again<br /><br />
You're out and someone else is in<br /><br />
We don't know where they've been<br /><br />
But choice is not a sin</p><br />

			        <p class="teaser_info"><p>I thought to buy you a trinket<br /><br />
to express the warmth in my heart for you.<br /><br />
Some small token that might find a home<br /><br />
next to your bed.<br /><br />
There were toys, lawn-gnomes<br /><br />
and rocking chairs<br /><br />
swaying in the cold April wind.<br /><br />
This life falls short of you<br /><br />
in my fleeting paradise beneath the spotlight<br /><br />
I remain incomplete. There is more<br /><br />
to my dream than was planned<br /><br />
I did not mean to love you<br /><br />
without my kingdom in place<br /><br />
I have no control.<br /><br />
Not over this grey morning<br /><br />
or the way the sun shines<br /><br />
not over my heart<br /><br />
which knows only your name<br /><br />
I found nothing to offer you but myself<br /><br />
and this handful of rain<br /><br />
tears from the Kansas City sky<br /><br />
symbols of a love<br /><br />
eternal</p><br />

where dreams die and take shape<br /><br />
where highways are twisted at the throat<br /><br />

sometimes with more choice<br /><br />
comes less freedom<br /><br />
more sugar in place of food<br /><br />
sirens for a handshake<br /><br />
bright lights casting longer shadows<br /><br />
soon the earth will erupt<br /><br />
and reshape the landscapes<br /><br />

to invade the invaders<br /><br />
with mountains for fingers<br /><br />
she brushes the cities<br /><br />

everyone goes down alone<br /><br />
with half a life to run away<br /><br />
and barely time to find a home.<br /><br />
Somehow we have made our peace<br /><br />
dodging the forms of our skeptic souls<br /><br />
I think tonight no one will bleed<br /><br />
and then perhaps no one grows old.<br /><br />
With simple words we scale a sonnet<br /><br />
balanced, all our hopes upon it.</p><br />

Staying up late</p><br />

This voice beneath the hum<br /><br />
I spend my nights alone with words<br /><br />
The echo of a drum<br /><br />
I love the way we talk<br /><br />
This language of the soul</p><br />
<br />

<p>I want to thank you for saying my name</p><br />

<p>Some thirst for perfection<br /><br />
guides my days. Like noise<br /><br />
in long breaths of scented smoke<br /><br />
the poison of poetic lust<br /><br />
grows in my blood like a weed<br /><br />
I accept this. Every hour<br /><br />
Pushing with what strength I have<br /><br />
Against yesterday</p><br />
<br />
<br />
<p>Where once was a child is now<br /><br />
A fool. He follows heat<br /><br />
And questions what is fire<br /><br />
I am this champion of doubt<br /><br />
Against what can't be named<br /><br />
I accept this. With my words<br /><br />
Construction of simple color<br /><br />
The unknown voice</p><br />
<br />
<br />
<p>Never seen. Decides what is real</p><br />
<br />
<br />
<p>And the sad eyes of exhaustion<br /><br />
ever wise. In this life will be</p><br />

Perched beside a campfire<br /><br />
Breathing in the stars<br /><br />
Without numbers<br /><br />

A lover's rage and a lonesome hunger<br /><br />
My true north and my blessings<br /><br />
Contented for now<br /><br />
And the flow of these images<br /><br />
Spirals of patience and love<br /><br />
As I drag my possessions behind me<br /><br />
Scraps of mortar and blood</p><br />
<br />
<br />
<p>I build myself a landscape<br /><br />
In the image of your grace<br /><br />
Asleep in the arms of innocence<br /><br />
A dream plays across your face</p><br />
<br />
<br />
<p>When the smoke has lifted<br /><br />
And the sun never again forgets to shine<br /><br />
Let us both remember such places<br /><br />
A thoughtful summer not quite wasted<br /><br />
Waiting for the lights to change<br /><br />
For one color to bleed into another<br /><br />
For the fuel to catch the flame<br /><br />
May nothing remain the same<br /><br />
Not quite yesterday<br /><br />
And never tomorrow<br /><br />
This nest of sorrows past<br /><br />
Of heaven misplaced</p><br />
<br />
<br />
<p>Asleep in the arms of desire<br /><br />
A dream plays across your face</p><br />

<p>My sweetest friend<br />
your heart is always pure<br />
I imagine life through your eyes<br />
and I wish that I could give more<br />
I only have one chance<br />
to build some blessed destiny<br />
with these words of mine<br />
this voice and these dreams</p><br />
<br />
<p>I am unraveled<br />
the walls of my heart are scoured clean<br />
I feel the seasons<br />
raw and hungry for completion<br />
the world is patient<br />
I am frantic in my lust<br />
for a perfect diamond<br />
some piece of god that I can touch</p><br />

<br />
<p>Again, time is quiet<br />
Motionless. I watch young winter<br />
Clutter the seasons<br />
Cold footsteps<br />
Across this checkered floor<br />
It is not enough to bleed<br />
As it once was<br />
Life is no longer priceless<br />
And the wave of dull destiny<br />
Will be taller than the sky<br />
When it comes.</p><br />
<br />
<p>I have cold stones in my heart<br />
And the color of desire<br />
Is dark against the night<br />
As the lights in Hollywood flicker<br />
Eyes opened and shut<br />
This is the fuel of the city<br />
Burning innocence.<br />
As if tomorrow<br />
Was not paid for with the<br />
Red faces of children<br />
I have dragged my net<br />
Across the deep</p><br />
<br />
<p>As good as love<br />
As I swallow fire<br />
Pray for me<br />
That I may sleep</p><br />

<br />
<p>I have wondered at the gray sky<br />
At the cycles of deceit<br />
And the shattering of mirrors…<br />
Is it enough to taste the salt of the ocean<br />
Like some love poem<br />
From across the world?<br />
Even as my own dreams run slowly<br />
Beneath this printed sunset<br />
They begin to die. This formula<br />
Is not good science. This city has forgotten<br />
Itself. The winter rains<br />
The Mississippi, front porches<br />
The path beyond the self<br />
With fire and plastic<br />
Replacing the mosquitoes.<br />
I opened my veins<br />
Blood is life is progress<br />
And this cluttered slope feels<br />
Like a prison<br />
Like a woman's flesh<br />
A mountain of sugar<br />
A long shortcut</p><br />
<br />
<p>I woke up today and my voice was<br />
Older than my heart<br />
Which carries a new scar<br />
The image of a better place.<br />
Let me see the earth dressed<br />
For the seasons.<br />
Let me see passion<br />
In the spectrum of time<br />
We replace the impossible<br />
With the same wicked fever<br />
That has burned heaven<br />
to the ground.<br />
Tonight I watch angels<br />
Illuminate the sky</p><br />

the solemn jest of circumstance<br /><br />

simple sacrifice. I belong to these fragments<br /><br />
of a martyr and his cause<br /><br />
a symphony in passing cars<br /><br />
survival and the art of breathing</p><br />

Your name stops time dead<br />

October like a bruise on your chin<br />
I summon the specter of poetry<br />
The phoenix<br />
Burning<br />
Born with an arrow in its wings<br />
This is the path<br />
And you have not risen<br />
Yet. All is torn<br />
From conflict and happiness<br />
Hurts, it makes no pattern<br />
You give life to the rain<br />
So it might come back with<br />
Answers attached<br />
Waiting for love<br />
As if you didn't know where to look.</p><br />
<br />
<p>We stumble through the future<br />
Some of us with magic<br />
In our fingertips<br />
Some with bitter dust<br />
On cracked lips<br />
Everywhere this motion<br />
Blind speed<br />
Rinse<br />
Repeat<br />
Rinse<br />
Repeat</p><br />

You've hidden your freedom<br /><br />
Beneath your desire<br /><br />
The known, the unknown<br /><br />
You have opened up this river<br /><br />
Flowing between love and fear<br /><br />
The answer is that you are blessed<br /><br />
And no one knows better than you<br /><br />
How to build heaven<br /><br />
Do not insult the world<br /><br />
with apologies - the beauty of your<br /><br />
heart never sleeps. Trust<br /><br />
that your voice carries strength<br /><br />
that your decisions are right<br /><br />
because you made them. You<br /><br />
will be loved<br /><br />
as you are now<br /><br />
as you were then<br /><br />
because destiny makes no mistake<br /><br />
you cannot hide from yourself<br /><br />
any more than you can run away<br /><br />
be glad for that precious pain<br /><br />
there is poetry under your skin;<br /><br />
you are aware<br /><br />
of the human tragedy - that we fall<br /><br />
madly through time<br /><br />
towards death<br /><br />
and truth<br /><br />
in the span of 30,000 sunsets<br /><br />
with only love to guide us</p><br />
<br />
<br />
<p>how sad<br /><br />
and exquisite</p><br />

I came at you like a man<br />
But now I want to be a girl<br />
She said you have to stay the same<br />
I can't change<br />
Oh horrid consistency</p><br />
<br />
<p>You are a good thing, I think<br />
But I don't know if I am blinded by your chords<br />
Or that feeling of wanting to covet or possess the<br />
truth you harmonize<br />
Do I just want a piece? Do I just want to be<br />
inspired?<br />
To be in the presence of a force<br />
To know that for a moment when the lights are low<br />
and the flame burns<br />
high<br />
That you are mine-to touch, to breathe in, to hold<br />
Briefly</p><br />
<br />
<p>In a city of the lost and found<br />
I smiled<br />
And you smiled back<br />
For a time I found you<br />
But in the pit of my stomach I have the creeping<br />
sensation of loss<br />
The echo chamber, the tug on the sleeve, the tap on<br />
the shoulder<br />
I can't hit snooze</p><br />
<br />
<p>So I will tell you about myself<br />
I will make the fatal error of maxim exposure<br />
I will smile and bat my eyes and<br />
Hope that you don't make me sorry</p><br />

			        <p class="teaser_info"><p>The art within myself<br />
Not myself within the art<br />
Good advice<br />
When all there is to this game:<br />
Passion and reason<br />
North and south.<br />
You speak so fluidly<br />
Every word like saltwater<br />
rising from the break<br />
The air bristling with it.<br />
And I am enclosed within this<br />
Letter, just a notion of sweet<br />
release, a blessing for you.<br />
Tomorrow looms large<br />
Like a glass tower and I will climb<br />
Those fragile steps without care.<br />
Looking out across rooftops<br />
And clouds of bitter chalk<br />
Drop my senses and watch them<br />
Fall (as if from the heavens).<br />
The essence of my path<br />
Has been chaos, and I would very grimly<br />
Speak of discipline<br />
And sacrifice were it not<br />
for the burden of truth.<br />
If there has ever been<br />
A home for my heartspeak<br />
It is this symbol of infinity<br />
That I cannot see.</p><br />
<br />
<p>Carry me, for one day<br />
Beautiful chaos<br />
Color the sky with a whim<br />
Anywhere there is motion<br />
Is a good place to begin</p><br />

Maybe I should drink some more poison<br />
Maybe there's no difference between love and<br />
frustration</p><br />
<br />
<p>Maybe I haven't wasted anything<br />
It seems so sudden, this shift<br />
This earthquake. But the sky was dark for months</p><br />
<br />
<p>And where do I find peace, now?<br />
Which way to something better, forgiveness<br />
I hate myself for being your victim</p><br />
<br />
<p>I still fantasize about your body but<br />
Now I have nightmares about your friendship<br />
About the words you never could say</p><br />
<br />
<p>If you love me, you still don't know why<br />
And it doesn't make you happy<br />
So why should it matter?</p><br />
<br />
<p>If I told you how many times I've said<br />
To myself: "You aren't going to call her ever again,<br />
unless..."<br />
You wouldn't believe it</p><br />
<br />
<p>Unless this, or that - if you'd call by Friday<br />
If you fucked me well, blew me whatever<br />
Unless nothing is the logical end</p><br />
<br />
<p>I feel no more pain, I should thank you<br />
For that but I won't<br />
I've been numb for a month now</p><br />
<br />
<p>If I could have it all again<br />
All the time I should have spent<br />
Instead of wasting it on love</p><br />
<br />
<p>like I didn't have enough</p><br />
<br />
<p>I knew in San Francisco, you took your dog<br />
And left me on the phone with Reception<br />
"I will be alone tonight, in fact..."</p><br />
<br />
<p>I can't be let down anymore<br />
I can't love you like this, anymore<br />
You chose your path<br />
I am choosing mine<br />
I choose no more disappointment<br />
A dusty road in August<br />
Away from Ohio<br />
Tell your mother you lost a friend<br />
Somewhere in West Hollywood</p><br />
<br />
<p>Goodbye</p><br />

Walk together, sleeping and<br />
Growing not old. Too much<br />
is a word from your lips, and sometimes<br />
Too little. There are reasons for<br />
No reason and lies painting truth about<br />
Ecstasy remembered and loveless projection<br />
And where are you, where am I when<br />
Time inches past and pain is only dull;<br />
When money like water puddles in the sun<br />
And the heat is a rough hand pushing?<br />
I am next to your skin with my teeth<br />
Beneath the flower of your pride<br />
With my palms at your weak side<br />
At arms to your defense.</p><br />

Be it your name that holds thick pleasure<br />
For this soldier at peace.<br />
Be it unspoken the conversation,<br />
And unwritten the pact that<br />
Brings my food to your table and<br />
your fingers to my cheek, your words<br />
to my canvas and if I regret<br />
again, as I did being lost, it will be that<br />
I wasn't lost with you<br />
Sooner. Because this is a shadow fallen,<br />
We are a wooden floor together, uncracked</p><br />

Have pushed me away from<br />
What I remember and there is but<br />
Madness. But I am halfway to nowhere<br />
And despite your enchanting presence<br />
There is no path from here to reach you.</p><br />
<br />
<p>Let no one say that I fell into this grave<br />
Let them see that I dug it first.</p><br />
<br />
<p> So between the days I reach to you,<br />
Your eyes are still with me. And behind<br />
The hours of work that we share, empty<br />
Responsible and serious<br />
I know that I would bring pleasure to you<br />
For lunch. In a letter<br />
Or with powerful thoughts. But there are<br />
Long highways sprawling between us,<br />
And my body is stuck<br />
Between the beach and the mountains<br />
Between strength and forgiveness<br />
Between love and true love.<br />
At a time where life is mostly<br />
Time-lined stressed and blind<br />
sweet bitter broken<br />
and fixed, I lose vision<br />
and sometimes hope. That maybe<br />
better is tomorrow, and again<br />
unbroken are you as<br />
I wish. May the autumn moon<br />
Shine on better days to come,<br />
Your foolish once lover<br />
Is not yet home</p><br />

stopped the car and put my ego down<br />
took a walk and a look around<br />
I found what I was looking for<br />
Everybody wants to be a star<br />
I know that because ot's in my heart<br />
doesn't matter who the fuck you are<br />
we all want to make it<br />
If it was a gift you would take it</p><br />
<br />
<p>I've been down and out and sometimes sour<br />
but I got skills and I got power<br />
ther's a sucker born every hour<br />
and I'm not like that<br />
so it's not so bad</p><br />
<br />
<p>Survival is the only teacher<br />
whiskey's good but love is sweeter<br />
I'm on time when I go to meet her<br />
and I try to bring a gift<br />
No one wants to go unwanted<br />
No one starts to not get started<br />
If you've been in love you've been broken-hearted<br />
but time keeps on picking up speed<br />
and we learn from the ways we bleed</p><br />
<br />
<p>I've been down and out and sometimes sour<br />
but I got skills and I got power<br />
ther's a sucker born every hour<br />
and I'm not like that<br />
so it's not so bad</p><br />
<br />
<p>I spent time in the handout line<br />
I washed dishes for some fucked up guy<br />
I stole bread and kisses and bottles of wine<br />
but that don't matter to me now<br />
because I'm alive and well somehow</p><br />
<br />
<p>I've been down and out and sometimes sour<br />
but I got skills and I got power<br />
ther's a sucker born every hour<br />
and I'm not like that<br />

<br />
We were sharing a computer at the time, and my GF found this poem and emailed it to me at work with the headline: <strong>what's up with this</strong>?<br />
</small></blockquote><br />
<br />
<br />
<p>I should not<br />
listen so well<br />
or remember the emotion<br />
at the expense of detail. I<br />
had been told such wonderful things<br />
about my perfect illusion that<br />
I also thought it was no different.<br />
My strengths are beginning to<br />
become weaknesses,<br />
liabilites. Unplanned explanations<br />
And I have nowhere to turn<br />
except inward. Again<br />
retreat, apology again<br />
selfish martyrdom<br />
again aggressive surrender.<br />
I have such pride<br />
in small things and large<br />
feelings, giant<br />
shadows and short friendships<br />
vast oceans of recycled bitterness<br />
and I spit all day red reasons,<br />
blood-red spirit<br />
that never flies. I asked for<br />
everything here<br />
I dreamed of the hope<br />
that would greet me like a mother<br />
greets a newborn and I<br />
found traces<br />
Nothing more. So if I<br />
speak painfully and if<br />
my truth doesn't fit you<br />
If you cannot understand my words<br />
then read your book. And<br />
the insult is your creation<br />
because honesty should never be<br />
qualified. I<br />
apologize for my soul<br />
and love is embittered, I break<br />
my stride and love falls<br />
I follow your whim<br />
and love is trivialized. So<br />
we can make a new pact and<br />
you can ponder petty victory<br />
because my need is greater,<br />
and because you have a woman's army<br />
but you have lost the<br />
unretrieveable. My heart<br />
no longer burns with your image.<br />
It grows cold</p><br />

This was copied from my book - in 1991 which was my first year in college. It can be seen as a sort of poetic exercise. I was at the time (and still am) enamored of E.E. Cummings and his creative use of punctuation, as well as his style of bending grammatical rules at his will. At this point, I was not yet even a committed Poetry major. Imagine 4 books full with poems like this written in the first 2 years of college, and you can see how I finally came to understand myself through poetry. I forced myself to write a poem every night before bed, whatever the circumstances.<br />

And pitiful<br />
As they watch for some important<br />
Shame, they treat life as a<br />
Mystery, and not -<br />
As they should -<br />
Like a game.<br />
Hypnosis.<br />
All is one, I<br />
Being, I<br />
Am within that one<br />
Which makes that one<br />

Waiting (I hate having to<br />

And suck<br />
Or any other armored sea food.<br />

			        <p class="teaser_info"><p>This is the first poem I wrote that I am proud of. I was six years and eight months old. It primarily makes me think of two things. One is that I was clearly first a poet - it was my first natural form of expression, along with possibly art but that is so common for kids of that age that it does not seem noteworthy. The fact that I was writing poems at such an early age means that must be my true calling. I was writing poems as early as 1978, and by 1981 I had a certain facility with it. Of course, I was sort of lacking in big concepts but that's why I like this one - it has a remarkable sense of self-awareness and mortality, which is arguably the richest of deep concepts.</p><br />
<br />
<p>Here it is:</p><br />
<br />
<blockquote>When I was One,<br />
I had just begun.<br />
When I was two<br />
I was nearly new.<br />
When I was three<br />
I was hardly me.<br />
When I was Four,<br />
I was not much more.<br />
When I was Five,<br />
I was just alive.<br />
But now I am Six,<br />
I'm as clever as clever<br />
So I think I'll be six<br />
now for ever and ever.</blockquote><br />

<br />
<p>Notice the slightly random sense of capitalization, I was still figuring out the rules. :)</p><br />
<br />
<blockquote>UPDATE: It has come to my attention that the above poem is identical to a poem called "Now We Are Six" by A.A. Milne, so I can't take credit for that one. I'm not sure why I would have copied a poem like that but I am assuming that was actually the assignment, to just copy something. Maybe it was a handwriting challenge. Anyway, that explains why I only got a 'check' (no 'check plus'). the poem was great, but not mine and not all physically written all that well, perhaps hence the average grade. So keep reading below for a few more poems that I did write at that age.<br />
</blockquote><br />
<br />
<br />
<p>The second thing this makes me think is that I was so lucky to have such a great school system. Looking back through my 'school papers' from those years - thankfully my parents kept it all - I am amazed to find so many poems. I think there are about a hundred poems from the 4 years between 1978 and 1981 - that is crazy to me. Many of them are sort of mundane and not that memorable, but I was finding a style and working it out and it is obvious that it was not just one teacher but most if not all of them that encouraged me to write poems because they could see that I liked doing it. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montessori_method">Montessori</a> school for the win. I really can't overemphasize how that sort of environment helped me become the person that I am.</p><br />
<br />
<p>Here are two more that I enjoy, from just 2 months before my 7th birthday:</p><br />
<br />
<blockquote>Running Moon - March 13 1981<br />
<br />
Sometimes when we drive out at night<br />
I see the half moon thin and white.<br />
It runs beside us like a hound<br />
It's there whenever I turn around.<br />
I say, "good moon, come on<br />
good moon. It won't be long<br />
we'll be home soon." And when<br />
we stop there in the sky<br />
the moon stands still<br />
as still as I.<br />

<br />
<blockquote>Untitled - April 1 1981<br />
<br />
Little snail,<br />

Weather and rose<br />
