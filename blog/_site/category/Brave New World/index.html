<p>It is possible that <strong>Somewhere</strong> gets by the gatekeeper for admission into the Radio Paradise playlist. That would be groovy. They are notoriously picky, and it is a privately run internet radio so it is up to the opinion of only 2 people. I am by no means approved yet but at least a song is getting reviewed now. The previous 5 were 'sorried' immediately. Oh the cruel whim of whimsy!</p>

<p>Please support <a href="http://www.radioparadise.com/">Radio Paradise</a> because they are awesome.</p>

<p>Sweet Thing</p>

<p>I was the revolution
you were the liberation
that falls from a pregnant sky
set loose on a Friday night
I know what you do to me
you give love in these little pieces
saving for a rainy day
I think you should give it away</p>

<p>Sweet thing, sweet thing
all you get is nothing
sweet thing, sweet thing
all you get is nothing when you put nothing in</p>

<p>she's high on the running away
here tonight and gone the next day
sweet like a candy girl
lasts as long as a dirty word
soft like a butterfly
hot like a brushfire
don't make me fall in love
if you don't want to be the one</p>

<p>Sweet thing, sweet thing
all you get is nothing</p>

<p>Yeah, yeah and you're feeling so much better
you're feeling so much better
Yeah, yeah and you're feeling so much better
you're feeling so much better</p>

<p>Sweet thing, sweet thing
all you get is nothing
sweet thing, sweet thing

<hr>


<p>This whole conversation reminds me of a Hemingway quote, which is:</p>

<p>'Write drunk. Edit sober.'</p>

<p>Of course I am not encouraging people to run out and start drinking, but the point I think here is that there are two very distinct stages to creativity. I agree it is a choice, but it is also a process that can be understood (to some degree).</p>

<p>Stage 1: let it flow. Write write write. Do NOT stand in your own way. Write as much as possible and NEVER self-censor. That is for stage 2. This is the creative muscle that needs to be exercised and to quote Voltaire: The perfect is the enemy of the good.</p>

<p>Stage 2: look at what you wrote as if someone else wrote it. Feel free to move back to stage 1 if you get a good idea. Remember that 99% will be not usable and that is as it should be. Another good concept (I don't know who said this first): Kill your darlings. That means that if there is one thing that you are REALLY excited about, it might be a good idea to get rid of it. Superstar tidbits tend to get in the way of the whole. Be honest with yourself.</p>

<p>Those two steps have served me well for 20+ years, and I got problems but a lack of creativity is not one of them. What tends to happen, I find, is that as you perfect this 2 step process, with the two steps so separated (flow versus scrutiny) your brain over time is actually able to do them simultaneously - and that is somewhere after your first 10,000 hours (read Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell for more on that). It is here that good things can occasionally just land on the page, fully realized. That is what people talk about when they say the song wrote itself. This has happened to me on many occasions and these are among my best works.</p>

<p>Lastly, remember that this is not about you, it's about what you are writing or creating. I have never once been able to consciously direct or insert meaning into anything. If you get good at step 2 you will find that often if not always the good stuff is not what you expected or wanted - it is the stuff that was NOT consciously created. It is the stuff that just happened along the way. That is why step 1 is so important - you will never know if it is good until AFTER you have finished it. So don't judge yourself until you have walked away for a moment and can move on to step 2.</p>

<p>Good luck everyone!</p>

<p>EDIT: apparently, this is the original 'kill your darlings' quote:</p>

<blockquote>Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch: 'Whenever you feel an impulse to perpetrate a piece of exceptionally fine writing, obey it - whole-heartedly - and delete it before sending your manuscripts to press. Murder your darlings'.</blockquote>


<p>Later this phrase became 'In writing, you must kill your darlings' which has been attributed to William Faulkner.</p>

<p><strong>If it were not for Steve:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>I would probably still be a Windows developer.</li>
  <li>My laptop would be a lot uglier.</li>
  <li>I would probably still have a cable TV subscription.</li>
  <li>I wouldn't love to hate iTunes so much.</li>
  <li>I wouldn't be tempted every day to buy an iPhone.</li>
  <li>I wouldn't be tempted every day to buy an iPad.</li>
  <li>The software development community would probably be very different and certainly for the worse.</li>
  <li><em>Finding Nemo</em> would never have made me cry.</li>
  <li>Today would not be such a sad day.</li>
</ul>


<p>Rest in peace, great man.<br></p>

							    <p class="teaser_info"><p>This is an important question. I am am the youngest in my generation and it seems that I am starting to get requests from people in my family for the song they want to be played at their funeral. Being the family musician and songwriter, it is fitting that I be tasked with putting playlists together when the people I love start moving up to heaven. Also, I plan on living forever so that way I'll be around.</p>

<p>So far, I've got a request for a Krister Axel song and a French folk song. May it be another hundred years before I have to honor any of these requests.</p>

<p>I would like to make the case that rationality dictates a hybrid philosophy. I think a combination of 'Past Positive' and future-oriented is the only logical choice.</p>

<p>Past Positive I think is necessary because it plays right into the most human of needs - the need to leave a lasting impression on the world. Call it an illusion if you will, ashes to ashes and all of that, but as a creative and an artist I know very well that most if not all artisanal pursuits deal with this - that we all want to create something that is worthy of immortality. If you are a painter, you want your art in a museum where it will live (presumably) beyond your own lifetime; if you are a songwriter you want your songs to be recorded by the next generation of artists, or for your own recordings to live on as a shining example of one's own time period; if you are a writer, you want your work (book, essay, screenplay) to reach an eminent status where it circles back around and influences young minds over and over again - Catcher in the Rye comes to mind, as a great example of that. What an impressive, infinite and immortal work that is. So I think living partially within the 'Past Positive' paradigm is essential to that sort of emphasis - to create, and to in a sense curate one's own archive of materials. Blogging feeds this need in a sense as well.</p>

<p>To be future-oriented is also important - as distinguished from the 'Transcendental Future' orientation - because as empiricism will suggest the best way to create a positive future is to be positive. Happiness begets smiling but so too does smiling beget happiness. As Gandhi said - 'we must be the change that we wish to see'. I think this is one of the most important truisms in our universe. Spiritually, future orientation is the only way to go - that is, if long-term health and happiness are important to you.</p>

<p>So, simply put, a rational and intelligent being will find a balance between these two time orientations. One might argue that a little present-hedonistic is not bad, but keep in mind - pleasures of the flesh are only meaningful when they are <em>additive</em>. Hedonism only positively affects happiness when it is used 'over the top', so to speak, where the structure for long-term happiness is already in place. For more on that see <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/martin_seligman_on_the_state_of_psychology.html">Martin Seligman on positive psychology</a>.</p>

<p>Also, see <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/mihaly_csikszentmihalyi_on_flow.html">Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi on flow</a> - I think flow is itself a hybrid present-hedonistic and future-oriented phenomenon.</p>

							    <p class="teaser_info"><p>Here&#8217;s what I wanted to mention &#8211; this <strong>Brave New World</strong>, I hope to use this category as something akin to my &#8216;morning pages&#8217;. Of course, for me, they are &#8216;night pages&#8217;. Let me explain.</p>


<p>I was having lunch nearby as I often do, and I usually bring a book or something to read &#8211; I use my phone as a backup, but it&#8217;s never the same. Books are still very useful to me. I have not yet tried Kindle. So there I was, and I sort of on a whim and without much thought brought a copy of &#8216;The Artists Way&#8217;, which someone gave to me a long time ago and I have never been able to get through much of it. I sit down at the bar, put my book next to me, and the bartender immediately says &#8211; &#8216;Great book! I read it and totally loved it.&#8217;</p>


<p>I&#8217;m trying to nod, and I can&#8217;t think of anything to say, and it becomes a bit of an awkward moment.</p>


<p>As is often the case, I am overcome with thoughts and I disengage from reality to some degree. By the time I come to, I have ordered lunch and a beer, and the guy is no longer talking to me. There had been two simultaneous thoughts running through my mind.</p>


<p>1 &#8211; Wow, that totally feels like an insult to me because I feel strongly that I am already a card-carrying &#8216;artist&#8217;, whatever that means, which suggests that I am already going the &#8216;Artists Way&#8217; and screw you for not knowing that;</p>


<p>2 &#8211; Wow, that guy is really reaching out to me and if I should probably acknowledge that in some meaningful way, his whole thing feels vaguely 12-step, there is something really touching about this, how did he experience the book exactly?</p>


<p>It was a real eye-opener for me. I almost felt called out as someone who is still searching for something, and even if I was what&#8217;s wrong with that? But ultimately, I was insulted in some way, and then I was surprised by how insulted I was, and then the inevitable guilt made me feel that I might be turning into a slightly more negative person than I used to be. All in the space of a minute or so, which made for one self-reflective burger.</p>


<p>Anyway, I did get through a bit of a chapter, which basically talked about what the author calls morning pages, which means everyone on the &#8216;Artists Way&#8217; should take the time to write every morning. I immediately thought of myself in college, where all through my dorm year and a few years after that I would force myself to write poetry at night, before I slept. I have a few thousand pages of that stuff. I understood the same concept way before this woman even wrote the book, so it felt vaguely self-affirming. The only problem is that I haven&#8217;t done that in years.</p>


<p>But every day is a new day in the brave new world.</p>
