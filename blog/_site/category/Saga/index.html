does not exist. As if
the struggle was against nothing
shadows and easy promises
empty air and reflections
but no road to walk on.</p>

<p>this window I have stared through
for a full season of my life
has no purpose. There is nothing to see
on the other side, only
more of the same. It is not
as I imagined.</p>

<p>the only feeling I have
is that of drifting. Along
some corridor in my mind
that leads into soft madness
like a cloud of cotton
behind my nose</p>

<p>It is possible that <strong>Somewhere</strong> gets by the gatekeeper for admission into the Radio Paradise playlist. That would be groovy. They are notoriously picky, and it is a privately run internet radio so it is up to the opinion of only 2 people. I am by no means approved yet but at least a song is getting reviewed now. The previous 5 were 'sorried' immediately. Oh the cruel whim of whimsy!</p>

<p>Please support <a href="http://www.radioparadise.com/">Radio Paradise</a> because they are awesome.</p>

			        <p class="teaser_info"><p>ISRC codes and other kinds of meta-information contained within songs allow us to track digital clone-copies across the infinite e-verse while keeping the related information consistent. The ISRC could be considered the primary key for each song and it consist of four codes for a total of 12 digits - country XX + identifier XXX + year XX + song number XXXXX.</p>

<p>What this means is that for a given country, you have 3 digits to play with (the identifier) before you run out of codes. The number here is just under 50 thousand:</p>

<pre>
      alphanumeric = 26 alphabetical characters + 10 digits (0-9).
 
      36 ^ 3 = 46,656
</pre>


<p>I'm lucky I applied for mine early enough to get a 'US' designation, it seems that all new applications are being assigned 'QM' which is the new stand-in for US because they ran out of codes.</p>

<p>Crazy!</p>

<p><a href="http://kristeraxel.com" title="Krister Axel" target="_blank">Krister Axel</a> and <a href="http://RockstarAlley.com" title="RockstarAlley" target="_blank">RockstarAlley</a> have the ISRC code: <strong>US Y3T</strong> and I suppose we were lucky to get it.</p>

<p>I get a little worried for the next generation of songwriters because some of things I had access to are going away. It's harder to get into Pandora, or listed in Wikipedia, and those are small things - but that's all there is. Small things. Now there are no more US ISRC codes.</p>

<p>What is the world coming to? :)</p>

<p>Anyway, here are the codes for the new album. The last song is possibly subject to change because I have changed my mind a few times already. I have a confirmed mastering session in July for Gavin Lurssen to master Sky Meet Sea, so needless to say I am very excited. This will be the first time my mastering engineer has a few Grammys under his belt.</p>

			        <p class="teaser_info"><p>This is a great lesson in why one must google oneself every now and again. I do this somewhere between every month and every quarter - both to verify my own SEO efforts but also to eavesdrop on anyone who is posting stuff on the internets about me. Sometimes, you find new things that you don't expect. Like that one time I found a whole album of live shots from a <a href="http://axel.me/3r" target="_blank">Hotel Cafe show</a> that I forget even existed.</p>

<p>Today, at the top of page 27 of my google search for 'Krister Axel review', I found this.</p>

<p>[caption id="attachment_1289" align="aligncenter" width="300" caption="John Popper jams with Krister Axel"]<a href="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/JohnPopper_1240018778.jpg"><img src="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/JohnPopper_1240018778-300x225.jpg" alt="" title="JohnPopper_1240018778" width="300" height="225" class="size-medium wp-image-1289" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>Yup, that is a really great shot of me jamming with the one and only John Popper. This was taken at South by Southwest in Austin, Texas around March of 2006. I was performing a set at the <a href="http://www.one2onebar.com/" target="_blank">One-2-One bar</a> (love that place) and in the middle of <a href="http://axelradio.com/track/southern-girl" target="_blank">Southern Girl</a>, John Popper hears the music through the window, likes it, walks in, someone hands him a microphone and he jams along. The timing was priceless. He took my solo for me. :)</p>

<p>So as it turns out, my friends over at One-2-One must have taken the picture, and are using it as one of their <a href="http://www.reverbnation.com/page_object/page_object_photos/venue_89531" target="_blank">profile photos with ReverbNation</a>. Thankfully someone put my name in the caption and google found it. Awesome.</p>

			        <p class="teaser_info"><p>This is an important question. I am am the youngest in my generation and it seems that I am starting to get requests from people in my family for the song they want to be played at their funeral. Being the family musician and songwriter, it is fitting that I be tasked with putting playlists together when the people I love start moving up to heaven. Also, I plan on living forever so that way I'll be around.</p>

<p>So far, I've got a request for a Krister Axel song and a French folk song. May it be another hundred years before I have to honor any of these requests.</p>

			        <p class="teaser_info"><p>Strasbourg was a total hit. What a great city. We loved the old town, we loved all of the canals and the much lower prices. I even tried the must-have local specialty <em>choucroute</em> (sauerkraut) with '7 different types of meat' -- they do love their butchers over in Alsace -- and it was really good. Surprisingly so. The cathedral is amazing, and second only to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathedral_of_Our_Lady_(Antwerp)" target="_blank">cathedral in Antwerp</a> which still takes the prize for <a href="http://mostawesomestthingever.com/" target="_blank">most awesomest</a> in my humble opinion.</p>

<p>The best part of Strasbourg has to be the bicycle paths. They are everywhere. It is a great feeling to just ride into the French countryside and follow signs to some random place for a beer. That was one of our best days in the whole trip.</p>

<p>We saw a really cool 'International High School' in old town Strasbourg. Right out of Harry Potter, it was. I would love for us to find a way to raise our kids here just so they could go to this school.</p>

			        <p class="teaser_info"><p>On our visit to Europe this summer, we ended up in a hotel for the first time very close to Saint Michel, near Odeon in the Latin Quarter which was one of my main stomping grounds back in the late 80's. It was great to be there again, and although Paris is getting hit more and more with graffiti it still seems to be holding up reasonably well. The fountain at Saint Michel and the statue at Odeon seem not to have changed at all, which is comforting, and because we were actually staying in the <em>quartier</em> this time we had a chance to walk around a lot more and explore the region. That was how we stumbled into discovering Saint Germain Des Pres, which I had always heard about growing up in Paris but never knew exactly where it was. It is a very nice little neighborhood and we stopped to have some coffee at <a href="http://www.lesdeuxmagots.fr/histoire.php" target="_blank">Les Deux Magots</a> which apparently used to be a hangout for Verlaine and Rimbaud among others. Here is a little photo essay of the church and some of the places nearby. Our little hotel on rue Git-le-Coeur boasted having had Allen Ginsberg as a guest.</p>

			        <a href="/2011/06/past-positive-and-future-oriented">past positive and future oriented</a>
			        <p class="teaser_info"><p>This is a reaction to an RSA Animate video called <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3oIiH7BLmg">The Secret Powers of Time</a> where:</p>

<blockquote>Professor Philip Zimbardo conveys how our individual perspectives of time affect our work, health and well-being...</blockquote>


<p>I would like to make the case that rationality dictates a hybrid philosophy. I think a combination of 'Past Positive' and future-oriented is the only logical choice.</p>

<p>Past Positive I think is necessary because it plays right into the most human of needs - the need to leave a lasting impression on the world. Call it an illusion if you will, ashes to ashes and all of that, but as a creative and an artist I know very well that most if not all artisanal pursuits deal with this - that we all want to create something that is worthy of immortality. If you are a painter, you want your art in a museum where it will live (presumably) beyond your own lifetime; if you are a songwriter you want your songs to be recorded by the next generation of artists, or for your own recordings to live on as a shining example of one's own time period; if you are a writer, you want your work (book, essay, screenplay) to reach an eminent status where it circles back around and influences young minds over and over again - Catcher in the Rye comes to mind, as a great example of that. What an impressive, infinite and immortal work that is. So I think living partially within the 'Past Positive' paradigm is essential to that sort of emphasis - to create, and to in a sense curate one's own archive of materials. Blogging feeds this need in a sense as well.</p>

<p>To be future-oriented is also important - as distinguished from the 'Transcendental Future' orientation - because as empiricism will suggest the best way to create a positive future is to be positive. Happiness begets smiling but so too does smiling beget happiness. As Gandhi said - 'we must be the change that we wish to see'. I think this is one of the most important truisms in our universe. Spiritually, future orientation is the only way to go - that is, if long-term health and happiness are important to you.</p>

<p>So, simply put, a rational and intelligent being will find a balance between these two time orientations. One might argue that a little present-hedonistic is not bad, but keep in mind - pleasures of the flesh are only meaningful when they are <em>additive</em>. Hedonism only positively affects happiness when it is used 'over the top', so to speak, where the structure for long-term happiness is already in place. For more on that see <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/martin_seligman_on_the_state_of_psychology.html">Martin Seligman on positive psychology</a>.</p>

<p>Also, see <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/mihaly_csikszentmihalyi_on_flow.html">Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi on flow</a> - I think flow is itself a hybrid present-hedonistic and future-oriented phenomenon.</p>

			        <p class="teaser_info"><p>Now that I am not doing that many shows any more, I feel like each one means more - which is an illusion. Things are what they are and we infuse them with drama and emotion and we compare to things in our past and we wonder why no one sees anything the same way. It is quite a game we play with ourselves, making sense of the nonsensical.</p>

<p>I had fun tonight, I played my new songs, my gorgeous wife was there with some of our friends and I felt like I could just barely taste again the flavor of performance. It's a drug, an intoxicating drug of habit and mystery and fleeting moments of perfection. It is also very much my past, and I realize that playing on a stage will forever make me feel young. Where there is challenge and uncertainty, yet hope, there is a path out of the mundane - the raw creativity of songwriting is what saved my adolescent self from itself, but the slot-machine draw of performance is what saved my adult self from nihilism. That is where I decided to never again care what other people think, to rise and fall as the captain of my own ship, and to feel worthy of anything I could conceive. I owe my wonderful marriage to the confidence I found as a performer - and I found a purpose within the doctrine of musical performance, where for the most part people respect each other and we listen to each other. I've said it before and I'll say it again - I owe my life to music, to songwriting and improvisation. We are all our best selves on stage - partly because we are forced to smile at the camera, partly because we are forced to be optimists in the face of all kinds of adversity, partly because we are doing what we love - and at least in my case, it helps fight the misanthropic tendencies I have in my heart. :)</p>

<p>I made some new friends tonight. I was very happy that everyone was absolutely outstanding. Justine Bennett, B Willing James, Joel Eckels - they all had their personal thing going and my style fit right in.</p>

<p>I got some video from the performance, but the lighting was pretty bad so I'm not sure how useful it will be. In any case, the camera guy did a great job. Matt Renoir - I'm sure guys in his profession have a saying about you are only as good as your lighting. He did the best he could and was a great sport, we talked about doing some work together again very soon.</p>

<p>My take away from this was that I really need to book a full slot, I'm a big fan of Mondays at Room 5 but for me, I really wanted to play a few songs back to back. Next up - find somewhere with good sound and great lighting and do a full set. That way it will be worth it taking HD video of the performance. Clearly I have the right guy for it.</p>

<p>Step 2: Send them to time out with an explanation of why they are going there.</p>


<p>Step 3: Walk away and stay away with no communication (1 minute per year of age of child). If they try to leave, put them back with no communication and their time starts over.</p>

<p>We had an amazing time.</p>


<p>I wanted to write some stuff down while it&#8217;s still fresh. I have long written for slightly figurative audiences &#8211; I have had a few different sites, and few different blogs, and always pulled them down eventually either as the march of progress or for lack of enduring desire to continue.</p>


<p>These writings, finally, are only for me and possibly future members of the Axel clan, and that&#8217;s about it. So I don&#8217;t have to feel any pressure. I stopped reading, and eventually stopped writing, for quite a spell through my late 20&#8242;s and early 30&#8242;s, I think largely due to general feelings of inadequacy and specific feelings of angst, but as I grow older I see the power of time more clearly and I am more proud every day of who I am. I have an amazing wife, a soon-to-arrive puppy, and a great future so I want to start again with what amounts to a personal diary.</p>

<p>There are a few main things I remember from this trip, I will try to write about them all. The first thing that comes to mind is the day-trip we took to Geneva, and although Geneva was gorgeous, what I remember most was the view of the Alps coming over the pass from the Jura valley and the great conversations I had with the cab drivers that took us there and back. It felt great to really dig in with my conversational French, and specifically on the way there I really got along with the cabbie. One funny note &#8211; in France, or at least in Jura, taxi drivers assume that the first person will sit in the front. It is very common for them to have stuff in the back seat, so two people taking a cab together will often get split up, one in front and one in back, which seems strange to an American. I was slightly hesitant but it turned out great because we were able to talk the whole way there, which is easily a 45 minute ride. As I think about it, there was a lady who drove us to Geneva and picked us up, but the guy I am talking about actually drove us to Le Grand Bornand from Les Rousses, which is more like a 90 minute ride. No wonder I feel like we got along so well &#8211; we spoke more or less non-stop for way over an hour. </p>


<p>I won&#8217;t get into all the things we talked about, but there are two that come to mind. First was when he asked me about gang violence in Los Angeles. I made a joke and said that yes, there are some bad neighborhoods, but they are mostly south and east of the main city hub, and if any funky cholos or gangbangers decided to come and mess with us in Hollywood, they would probably get stuck in traffic and end up turning around to go home. The point I was making was that L.A. is huge and has a lot of different stuff going on. He thought about that and mentioned that Lyon is like that, or at least certain regions around there, so I took a mental note. Apparently, they also have some amazing restaurants and I almost took us there for a day or two over this trip (we opted for Besançon instead) so that felt a bit like I dodged a bullet. Anyway, he also made a very shrewd point &#8211; which was oddly prescient &#8211; that the difference between France and the US is simply that in France, it&#8217;s mostly just the cops who have guns, and in the US anyone can get their hands on one. He went on to say that it&#8217;s a very effective policy because gangs can only be so bad as long as they are not armed to the teeth. Of course, we got home and in less than a week we had that horrible shooting of <a title="Gabrielle Giffords" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabrielle_Giffords" target="_blank">Gabrielle Giffords</a> and he could not have been more right. Not that gangs were involved per se, but it was clearly a problem with unfettered access to guns by people who should not have ANY access to guns &#8211; in this case a guy with a well documented history of mental illness.</p>


<p>On a less somber note, one of the other things we talked about was Switzerland, which was very interesting. He asked us about our day trip to Geneva the day prior &#8211; there is really only one cab company that serves the Jura region, and he was apparently the boss, so he must have known about our whole schedule. I answered that everything was closed, and he said of course, they are very devout Christians over there (it was a Sunday). I had no idea. Our trip was fun, but all the shops were closed, and now I know why. It turned out to be a blessing, because we probably would have spent a lot more money had the shops been open. There looks to be very good shopping in Geneva although it is quite a pricey town. So we ended up on a bit of a odyssey, basically just looking for places to go that weren&#8217;t closed. We did a lot of walking, as usual. We visited the St. Pierre Cathedral, which was beautiful, and learned about Geneva&#8217;s role in the <a title="protestant reformation" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_Reformation" target="_blank">Protestant Reformation</a> (fascinating). We also saw Calvin&#8217;s chair, which I loved because I have a thing for relics &#8211; inorganic ones, to be sure. Old bones kind of freak me out. Anyway, we ended up at the museum of Archeology, which was more or less a children&#8217;s museum, but was still sort of fun. It was pretty cold that day, definitely a hat scarf and gloves kind of affair, and when we got there we were surprised to learn that entry was free and that the coat room was out in the open, completely unmonitored, and that we were expected to just leave our stuff there. We thought about it for a second, but we really wanted to pull all of our layers off, and so with a &#8216;when in Rome&#8217; attitude we followed suit. An hour or so later, we were happy to see that our stuff was still where we left it.</p>


<p>So I mentioned this to the taxi driver, and he laughed. He said yup, they still work on the honor system in Switzerland. The entire society is very honest and collectively they enjoy a sort of regulated state utopia. They have somehow managed to build in some ways an ideal society. He mentioned that they still sell newspapers on the honor system &#8211; there is a box full of papers, which you just open and pull out a copy and they trust you to then put the right amount of coins in the strongbox. I remember him saying &#8211; &#8220;et si c&#8217;etait en France, dans 5 minutes, il n&#8217;y aura rien, et dans la boite, pas un sou&#8230;&#8221;</p>


<p>So Switzerland really is an anomaly.</p>

<p>That's the name of the little guy we saw on our first day of cross country skiing in Le Grand Bornand. We decided to call him the Duke, and figured that we didn't see him again because he was probably too busy hanging out with Fernando back at the hotel.</p>

<table style="width:auto;"><tr><td><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/o_vZIEK8arDRHpRCL9n9C5i42ncwKoU7q4CX0xgHeYA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_aJ4urxfgN9A/TSt-KYk6CBI/AAAAAAAAAt4/XJVC3o9fgEM/s400/DSC00670.JPG" height="300" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td style="font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:11px; text-align:right">From <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/krister.axel/FranceAndSwitzerland201011?authkey=Gv1sRgCO2DsLKHiJPwWA&feat=embedwebsite">France and Switzerland 2010-11</a></td></tr></table>


<p>This is how it happened - the day we got to Le Grand Bornand, the main cross country slope that you can access directly from town was closed for lack of snow, so we were forced to take the bus over to <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/place?ftid=0x478bfa0994e44959:0x2608ab2be373be21&q=france+les+plans+grand+bornand&gl=us&hl=en&dtab=0&sll=45.935559,6.485623&sspn=0.031044,0.06403&ie=UTF8&ll=45.975969,6.388378&spn=0,0&z=13" target="_blank">Les Plans</a>. This was a gorgeous enclosed valley, and it had snowed recently. There were not too many people around, and it was really a beautiful morning. I think it was around 11am by the time we finally were doing our first run - we were up much earlier, but it took a while to figure out where to go and how to get there.</p>

<p>So Les Plans has a little 5k loop that takes you to the edge of the valley and back - it crosses a little mountain stream and goes through the woods.</p>

<p>We were finishing our first loop when I saw something going on out of the corner of my eye. I stopped skiing, because I knew something was up. Just as stopped, looking to my right, I saw two beady eyes and a little mouse-looking creature with snow-white fur who was poking his head out of the snow, like a little submarine telescope. Luckily, Lavinia wasn't too far ahead, and I was able to get her to stop and look just as 'the Duke' stood up and gave us another look. This time he looked at us for a few seconds, and cocked his head a little like he was sizing us up. I think I said 'Hey little guy!', and then he was gone.</p>

<p>I wasn't able to get the camera fast enough, but this is a stock photo of a fouine -</p>

<p>We don't have them in the US, but in Britain they call them 'stone martens'. We took that to be a sign of good luck, because they don't interact with people much at all. Later that day, when were having lunch nearby, I asked the waitress about it.</p>

<p>They had a stuffed marmotte on the wall, which is basically a european squirrel, and I pointed to it and said - in French of course - 'we just got back from skiing, and we saw something sort of like that, but smaller, all in white...' - and she interrupted me. It was probably a fouine, she said. In the winter, their coats change to match the snow. Fascinating.</p>

<p>I have not been able to find a picture of a fouine with it's winter coat - so I imagine it is a pretty rare sighting. It really made our day, and felt like a sign that Le Grand Bornand was indeed a magical place. We hope to get back there soon.</p>

<p>UPDATE: I found a picture of a white 'hermine', which I don't think is exactly the same animal but clearly a close cousin. Our little guy was smaller, and his eyes seemed to be more red around the edges.</p>

			        <p class="teaser_info"><p>Here&#8217;s what I wanted to mention &#8211; this <strong>Brave New World</strong>, I hope to use this category as something akin to my &#8216;morning pages&#8217;. Of course, for me, they are &#8216;night pages&#8217;. Let me explain.</p>


<p>I was having lunch nearby as I often do, and I usually bring a book or something to read &#8211; I use my phone as a backup, but it&#8217;s never the same. Books are still very useful to me. I have not yet tried Kindle. So there I was, and I sort of on a whim and without much thought brought a copy of &#8216;The Artists Way&#8217;, which someone gave to me a long time ago and I have never been able to get through much of it. I sit down at the bar, put my book next to me, and the bartender immediately says &#8211; &#8216;Great book! I read it and totally loved it.&#8217;</p>


<p>I&#8217;m trying to nod, and I can&#8217;t think of anything to say, and it becomes a bit of an awkward moment.</p>


<p>As is often the case, I am overcome with thoughts and I disengage from reality to some degree. By the time I come to, I have ordered lunch and a beer, and the guy is no longer talking to me. There had been two simultaneous thoughts running through my mind.</p>


<p>1 &#8211; Wow, that totally feels like an insult to me because I feel strongly that I am already a card-carrying &#8216;artist&#8217;, whatever that means, which suggests that I am already going the &#8216;Artists Way&#8217; and screw you for not knowing that;</p>


<p>2 &#8211; Wow, that guy is really reaching out to me and if I should probably acknowledge that in some meaningful way, his whole thing feels vaguely 12-step, there is something really touching about this, how did he experience the book exactly?</p>


<p>It was a real eye-opener for me. I almost felt called out as someone who is still searching for something, and even if I was what&#8217;s wrong with that? But ultimately, I was insulted in some way, and then I was surprised by how insulted I was, and then the inevitable guilt made me feel that I might be turning into a slightly more negative person than I used to be. All in the space of a minute or so, which made for one self-reflective burger.</p>


<p>Anyway, I did get through a bit of a chapter, which basically talked about what the author calls morning pages, which means everyone on the &#8216;Artists Way&#8217; should take the time to write every morning. I immediately thought of myself in college, where all through my dorm year and a few years after that I would force myself to write poetry at night, before I slept. I have a few thousand pages of that stuff. I understood the same concept way before this woman even wrote the book, so it felt vaguely self-affirming. The only problem is that I haven&#8217;t done that in years.</p>


<p>But every day is a new day in the brave new world.</p>

			        <p class="teaser_info"><p>So this family tree thing is a total obsession right now. I have been <a href="http://axel.tribalpages.com/" target="_blank">rocking out</a> on it and the coolest thing happened. I got a match. I searched on one of my ancestors in the Swedish <a href="http://disbyt.dis.se/" target="_blank">census</a>, Bond Anders Andersson and got a match. As it turns out, there is a whole <a href="http://olaus-laurentii.liss.pp.se/index_e.htm">society</a> dedicated to the ancestors of this Olaus Laurentii guy. Pretty cool &#8211; we are direct descendants of his, my sisters and I.</p>


<p>Interesting note &#8211; if you look at the wikipedia page for Olaus Laurentii, you get this:</p>


<hr /><strong>Olaus Laurentii</strong> (died 25 June 1438) was a Swedish ecclesiastic and <a title="Archbishop of Uppsala" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archbishop_of_Uppsala">archbishop of Uppsala</a>.</p>


<p>Olaus Laurentii (who is known under the <a title="Latin" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin">Latin</a> form of his Swedish name <strong>Olof Larsson</strong>) came from <a title="Uppland" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uppland">Uppland</a> and studied at the universities of <a title="Charles University of Prague" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_University_of_Prague">Prague</a>, <a title="University of Leipzig" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Leipzig">Leipzig</a> and <a title="University of Paris" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Paris">Paris</a>. He was elected Dean of <a title="Uppsala Cathedral" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uppsala_Cathedral">Uppsala Cathedral</a> in 1417 and archbishop in 1432. He was ordained in Rome 18 May 1432.</p>


<p>In the conflict between king <a title="Eric of Pomerania" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_of_Pomerania">Eric of Pomerania</a>, the ruler of the <a title="Kalmar Union" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalmar_Union">Kalmar Union</a> countries, and the archbishop <a title="Johannes Gerechini" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Gerechini">Johannes Gerechini</a> in 1419, Olaus acted on behalf of the king and as a diplomatic envoy to Rome in the negotiations to get Johannes Gerechini deposed and the Vadstena monk <a title="Johannes Haquini (page does not exist)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Johannes_Haquini&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">Johannes Haquini</a> elected and ordained (1422) as new archbishop. When he died in 1432, the chapter elected Olaus new archbishop. Olaus had spent long periods in the previous years in Rome and was in good standing with the pope, but the king preferred bishop <a title="Arnold of Bergen" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_of_Bergen">Arnold of Bergen</a>. After Arnold died, he was replaced by <a title="Torlav of Bergen (page does not exist)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Torlav_of_Bergen&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">Torlav of Bergen</a>. Olaus had been ordained by the pope already in 1432, but was accepted by the king only in 1435, during the rebellion of <a title="Engelbrekt Engelbrektsson" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engelbrekt_Engelbrektsson">Engelbrekt Engelbrektsson</a>. In 1436, Olaus and the <a title="Privy Council of Sweden" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privy_Council_of_Sweden">Privy Council of Sweden</a>, over which he presided, turned their back on the king and joined the rebellion.</p>


<p>Olaus Laurentii is said to have died from poisoning by <a title="Almond milk" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almond_milk">almond milk</a>, and according to a later source the regent (later king) <a title="Charles VII of Sweden" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_VII_of_Sweden">Karl Knutsson (Bonde)</a> was responsible.</p>


<p>In 1435, Olaus consecrated the new <a title="Uppsala Cathedral" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uppsala_Cathedral">Uppsala Cathedral</a> which had been under construction for two centuries.</p>


<hr />Which doesn&#8217;t seem to jive with this:</p>


<hr />Olaus Laurentii (1543-1607) was the vicar in Gagnef, the province of Dalarnas län, from about 1572 until his death, and may be considered the most known of the early inhabitants of the parish. He is known by most genealogists focused on this parish, as the ancestor of many, still existing, family branches in Gagnef.</p>


<hr />


<p>Which is what I found in the Laurentii family tree.</p>


<p>It seems to me that there may be a valid explanation here, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olaus_Laurentii" target="_blank">wikipedia Olaus Laurentii (died 25 June 1438)</a> may have been an ancestor of <a href="http://olaus-laurentii.liss.pp.se/olaus_e.htm" target="_blank">Olaus Laurentii (1543-1607)</a>.  To be clear, we have direct lineage to the later Olaus Laurentii (1543-1607), but even the Laurentii website stops cold at Olaus born 1543. The trick is bridging that 100 year gap from 1438 to 1543. It looks like no one has done that yet, although it does seem sort of obvious. I will post more on that later if I can find any genealogical evidence behind the earlier Olaus.</p>

<p><strong>haiku<br />
05.23.07</strong><br />
I have a firepit now. So I'm writing haiku about it.
<i>
The taming of fire<br />
We are all turned to ashes<br />
in the hot center<br />
</i></p>

<br />


<br />


<p>In other news, I'm going to Europe for my cousin's wedding. Germany. I'll be playing piano at the reception in Stuttgart.</p>

<br />


<p>I will also be doing some performances at the Santa Monica Farmer's Market this year, making the big bucks (I just found out today).</p>

<p><strong>a poem written in Mae Sot<br />
04.01.07</strong><br /></p>

<br />


<p>I found this today in a notebook I had with me over Christmas.
This was written the morning after I spent my first night in Mae Sot (Thailand).</p>

<br /><br /><br />


<p><i>A dog barks at the morning prayer<br />
and the sky remembers everything<br /></p>

<p>the smoke-filled houses<br />
leaned against each other<br />
the wild green hand of nature<br />
clutching at humanity. Go ahead<br />
and die, says the world<br />
we will not find you<br />
in your toothpick temples<br />
eating rice and leaves. Your children<br />
are not lucky enough to feel<br />
the breath of medicine.<br />
There is no love to spare.</i><br /></p>

<p>The pictures from Thailand and Burma are now here. <br /><br /></p>

<p>The story:<br /><br />
Last year in December, both Lavinia and I traveled to Thailand to visit her mother Selia who has volunteered for almost a year now as a teacher's teacher for an organization called <b>The Curriculum Project</b>. We spent most of our time in Mae Sot, which is an important border town between Thailand and Burma.<br />
Many of the Burmese refugee camps are in this area. Most Burmese refugees are of Karen descent, and are the only remaining freedom fighters against the heavy-handed Burmese government - since the Buddhist Karenni faction sold out to the Burmese military regime just a few years ago. There is always hope that these kind-hearted Burmese peasants will find peace and prosperity some day soon. Click the contact link above left if you would like to donate directly to the orphans in the photos depicted here.<br /><br />
While we were there, General Bo Mya passed away in his late seventies, who was easily the most important spokesperson for the Christian Karen faction. Bo Mya was quite literally a folk hero and military legend. Attending his funeral in Burma (Myanmar) was a once-in-a-lifetime experience for Lavinia, her brother John, her mother Selia and I.</p>

<p>I'll be in San Fran this weekend for a show, I'm looking forward to that. <b>Arms Around the River</b> will be mastered on Dec. 7th
 and then I'll send it out to be pressed - the cd release party will be at the <b>Hotel Cafe</b> in Hollywood early next year.</p>

<br />


<p>These are some of my best songs yet - Marc Moreau did the mixing, along with my friend Brandon Krueger who mixed a few tracks and Cythia Catania who had a hand in it as well.</p>

<br />


<p>This will be the third album I've produced and I am really getting the hang of it.</p>

<br />


<p>For the record, the songs that I have had playing from my site for the last few months are not the songs that will be featured on the album - I have some outtakes, some
really esoteric Krister Axel songs, and some live stuff available here on the website that WILL NOT be featured on the next album (not all of it, at least). I'm sorry if I did not make that clear early on.</p>

<br />


<p>I guess maybe there really is a market for the Krister Axel version of <b>Georgia On My Mind</b>.<br /><br />
I suppose I'll have to put out a cover album <i>a la</i> <b>Perfect Day</b> by Chris Whitley. That'll be my next project.<br /><br /></p>

<p><small>I found this in an old notebook, dated 05.17.1997 (written in Madison, WI).</small><br /><br />
just this little stash of survival</p>

<br />never had a moment to think


<br />radio voices sound like someone I know


<br />moonlight makes me want to have a drink


<br />I listen to the rhythm of the traffic


<br />hiding in the silence I project


<br />push me through the womb of the future


<br />bear me as an infant to protect


<br />an island on the ocean planet 'solo'


<br />wailing of the unborn tragedy


<br />wiping from my eyes the mess of martyrs


<br />the burden of my passage through the freeze

For the record, I never cancel a show. I have to go back to March 10th, 1995, for the last show cancellation that
I was ever party to. Over ten years ago - at <b>The Chamber</b>, Madison, WI (no longer there). Good times.<br /><br />
Anyway, the reason was that I had an invitation to the Playboy Mansion that I couldn't refuse. So thank you all for being so understanding.</p>

<p>This is Hef's pet Toucan. He's got monkeys, rabbits, birds. It is literally a zoo. A really little one. I didn't like it at all. Very natural
looking, except of course for all the cages.<br /><br />
I hate to be judgemental, and I am not intimate with the details, but it does seem to me that if people like Hef each gave a small
but significant push for progressive politics instead of stuffing Toucans into cages, we might not be in quite the mess that we are now.
Anyway, thanks for the invite buddy. <br /><br />
So that's it and here I am - signing off from Hef's mini-zoo, where the playmates still wear the same outfits, but now in modern pastels.</p>

<strong>Sunset Boulevard<br /></p>

<p>08.15.06</strong><br /><br />
I work on Sunset now<br />
where dreams die and take shape<br />
where highways are twisted at the throat<br />
of the green that once was<br />
sometimes with more choice<br />
comes less freedom<br />
more sugar in place of food<br />
sirens for a handshake<br /></p>

<p>bright lights casting longer<br />
and longer shadows<br />
soon the earth will erupt<br />
and reshape the landscapes<br />
in her likeness<br />
to invade the invaders<br />
with mountains for fingers<br />
she brushes the cities<br />
from her brow. As if<br /></p>

<p>to invent a simple fabric<br />
between God and Man<br />
she turns over<br />
her bed<br /></p>

<strong>Jamaica<br />
08.07.06</strong><br /></p>

<br /> <font color="#666666"><small><i>August fights with bold teeth




<br />the rumor of a cold winter</i></font></small>


<br /><br />I don't know why I said that. It never gets cold in Los Angeles.


<br /><br />I was in Jamaica not much more than a month ago. It feels like much longer than that - it is amazing how long you can put things off for.


<p>We were there for the 4th of July and it was in full bloom, the sun was hot and the breeze was cold. The streets in the big cities were mostly
all right and the highway to Negril was almost new, but everywhere else there are holes in the street like missing teeth.
The land is so rich and green but the people are very poor. Buildings everywhere along the smaller highways stand in a half-constructed ethereal realm.
The whole western island seems to be in perpetual work-in-progress mode where the bags of gravel lay untended and the doors are all open as if the notice
came suddenly that there was no reason to work anymore.<br /><br />
We had a great time and Jamaica is a gorgeous country but it is a bit unsettling to know how much power money has been given in our society.<br />
Lavinia and I rented a car in Montego Bay and drove all the way to Treasure Beach. It was such a long drive that we decided to
split it up on the way back and stay in Negril for the night en route.</p>

<p>This is Lavinia, in all her hotness. There is not much more to say about this picture, she is the love of my life and it is also quite obvious that she is the sexiest woman that has ever lived. Here she is just outside <b>Jack Sprat's</b>. The water was very blue at that beach.
That was a good day.</p>

<br /><br />I brought my <i>Martin</i> and played it a lot. Lazy days.

<p>I got to play some music, I played a few songs during the set break one night at the hotel. It was totally unplanned and was a real highlight for me.
I met a jamaican musician named Toby One and we became friends. Cool man. His friend Wendell played tambourine and held the mic stand.</p>

<br />


<p>People all over the world are amazingly gracious and giving. Everyone we met was essentially kind. It is just a shame that such a beautiful
place can be in effect annexed by big-business tourism without the people of Jamaica ending up with much of anything at all.</p>

<p>Kim tells me there is a video rental shop in Melbourne where she grew up that is constantly playing <strong>Loco Girl</strong> and other songs off of <strong>Dirt Floor</strong> for the customers, and if you can guess the name of the song they will give you a free rental.

<p>I have always wanted to play a show at <strong>the Stone</strong>. It is right in Hollywood and I know the lights
will be shining on us in the hip dive room of our time. Hollywood is the new West Hollywood which puts Koreatown in
as the next Hollywood.<br />
Anyway <strong>Sally Jaye</strong> is a total heartbreaker, <strong>Shawn Pander</strong> is like molasses on
broken glass and <strong>Brandon Krandon</strong> will make you believe. We got everything
from a diddled-eyed Joe to a damned if I know.</p>

<br />I'm glad you'll be going. They serve 4 kinds of whisky and I plan to try every one.


<br />


<br />Get there early, stay late and drink just like it's Saturday.


<br />I will be playing acoustic guitar for the first time in a while, and if the wind blows right I may get my

I was talking to a friend of mine last week, and he asked me what I've been up to.<br />
I replied that I was adding some informative current events
links to my home page in such a way that I can update and append to them often and easily.
His reply was: <i>what are you doing that for</i>?<br /><br /></p>

<ul>
<li>which I thought was sort of odd. We are literally exploding the federal deficit, funneling hundreds of billions
of taxpayer dollars every year into wrong-headed priorities for a clumsy military. International diplomacy is at an all-time low
and the value of the dollar is eroding but you wouldn't know it by watching TV or reading any of the major newspapers. <br />
Not to mention the completely overt lawlessness of a power-drunk and peerlessly incompetent administration.<br />
Yet, there is no perceived need for unbiased information.<br />
That's a lot of kool-aid.</li>

<p><strong>05.15.06</strong><br /><br /></p>

<br />Yesterday was my birthday.


<br />




<br />Life is really good these days. My new album <strong>iMTHEGUN</strong> is coming along nicely. 


<p>I have a recording session coming up at <a href="http://www.newmonkeystudio.com/" target="_blank">NEW MONKEY STUDIOS</a>,
which some of us will remember as the studio that was
a labor of love for <strong>Elliot Smith</strong>, that tragic and beautiful poet.</p>

<br /><br />


<p>It will be a very deep experience to explore my own creativity as a songwriter and composer on his beloved keyboards. I have
always found that every instrument has its own voice and personality, and this is even more true for vintage keyboards like antique pianos
 from 1917 and a 50's-era harmonium. Sigh.
 <br /> <br />
 Every time I meet a new piano, a song is written. This has never failed me.<br />
 The best part is that I am finally doing a recording to tape in a place where I know the air will be full
 of muses and electricity and above all, microphones.
 <br /><br /></p>

<p>I won't be gigging very much this summer, but if you live near San Diego you can catch a show with the full band
on <strong>Coronado Island</strong>.<br />
It's an outdoor Cancer Benefit called <strong>RELAY FOR LIFE</strong> on SAT JUNE 10th.<br /><br />
Yes, I'm having two birthday parties;<br />
and yes, I quit the <strong>Cheyenne Kimball</strong> band, for reasons that shall remain private - I will say only that we parted on good terms and I wish her nothing but the best. <br>
I think on the <strong>MHD Network</strong> they are still airing a live show that I did with her in Breckinridge this past January.</p>

<br />Highlights:


<p><li>Witnessing a true legend perform, Ian McLagan.</li>
<li>Jamming with John Popper. He literally walked in off the street while I was playing a song, and stepped up to the mic with his harmonica. It was gorgeous.</li>
<li>Singing <i>We'll Sweep Out The Ashes In the Morning</i> with <a href="http://www.naimee.cjb.net/" target="_blank">Naimee Coleman</a> at the Gram Parsons tribute.</li></p>

<p><li>Seeing Josh Ritter for the first time.</li>
<li>Sitting in on keys with Ernie Halter.</li>
<li>Playing two-on-a-keyboard with Jenni Alpert while Tom Freund sang <i>You Ain't Going Nowhere</i>. </li></p>

<pre><code>    I've been playing keys lately with Sony/Epic artist Cheyenne Kimball and it's pretty awesome. In the past month I've met some very cool people from both Sony and MTV. Cheyenne's new show on MTV will be airing early this summer, called &lt;strong&gt;Cheyenne 15&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;
  Yup, she's 15 and she rocks.   &lt;br /&gt;
  So while I'm writing more songs for my next album I'll be on the road with Cheyenne. Here are some photos from our show at the Breckenridge Riverwalk Center for the MHD Network&lt;strong&gt; Music with Altitude&lt;/strong&gt; Concert Series. It was about 10 degrees Fahrenheit but who cares - this is rock and roll, baby.&lt;br /&gt;

<p>      This was a first for me, everywhere we went there were cameras. It's fun for about 45 seconds and then it gets annoying. Poor Cheyenne didn't have a moment's peace. MTV was very cool though, good people. Thank god for that, it could have been a lot worse. Be careful what you wish for, imminent fame = 0 privacy.<br /></p>

<p>09.15.05</p>

<p>  In September I see boots before
  the first rain, vast migrant flocks
  flying before the last late sunset
  threatens: a strange, nervous pox
  which might never find a certain cure
  where the stricken fly in nervous flocks</p>

<p>  In September I can't focus, I
  am estranged, staring out
  at the passional leaves so proud
  to be falling so many
  dreams happily dying and by
  each day these old colors flushing out.</p>

<p>  Is that not the way, in September
  of all things answering to
  love? To be sudden, elegant
  and trampled like the fallen truth
  in September when time is so fast
  and every moment is the last</p>

<p>  moment of summer<br></p>

The last days of summer in Los Angeles. It's been good to be back. <br>
I have two songs that just made it on a to an Indie movie directed by my friend Ryan Byrne, details to follow.<br> 
I'm back in the studio with my friend Babyhead, working on <b>I'm the Gun</b> and <b>Always a Circle</b>. 
I'm also sitting in at <a href="http://www.room5lounge.com/" target="_blank"><b>Room 5</b></a> tonight with some friends (Joel Eckels, Jay Nash and Shane Alexander), come by if you're in the area. We're starting at 8pm. <br><br>

<p>07.14.05 London Tragedy = Hope<br><p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <table style="width:auto;"><tr><td><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/piVCp27FqJAgEm95y653fQ?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_aJ4urxfgN9A/TXc-wjP3v1I/AAAAAAAAIpg/FRaS-DwpdGM/s800/SUC50024.jpg" height="225" width="300" /></a></td></tr><tr><td style="font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:11px; text-align:right">From <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/krister.axel/Stuff?feat=embedwebsite">stuff</a></td></tr></table><br></p>

<p>  <br>
  London is just a gorgeous city, plain and simple. This is a fact. <br>
  <br>
Being a lover of distant places, my whole experience there was sort of bittersweet because of course it wasn't about me at all. The day after I got there, some bombs went off on the Underground and on a bus, and the whole city went into a state of shock. There was no way to get around the city, all the means of transportation had been shut down, and the show that I had come to do was cancelled because there would have been no one there. Suddenly, my whole agenda as a performer and a songwriter was made to seem very petty, and I was glad to be alive. I wrote a lot of lyrics, and spent some time exploring what is important to me. This ancient, vibrant, aesthetic masterpiece of a city was wounded and I could do nothing. I don't know what I expected to happen, but in the end what I remember is the kindness of everyone I met.</p></p>

<p> I'm thinking of the city
  with its arms around the river
  with no end and no beginning

  like a chain of stars
  It's trying to tell me something
  about the light between two lovers
  the light that's on your face
all you have to do
shine on for me
  if you can't afford to sleep

  I'll be the push that brings you back
  it's Saturday
  and there's something in the air
  I don't believe that we are lost
I don't believe that we are lost</p>


<p>And I took a lot of pictures. That first day of the tragedy when the streets were swollen with sad faces and the sun came out in the afternoon I was mesmerized, taking pictures of all the beauty I could fit onto a camera lense. The flowers, the facades, the trees, the monuments - cathedrals tucked away like toy houses, and everywhere the proud and worn face of centuries. I am completely in love with this city.</p>

<p>06.13.05 NXNE in Toronto and the House of Blues<br></p>

<p>It was another one of those weekends. It went by in a flash of lights and humidity, the first Spring weather in Toronto and everyone was out in the streets. A beautiful city, alive in ways that we don't see in LA. The streets are packed and there are trams and cobblestones and the whole place has that lived-in feeling like a pair of jeans or an old fireplace.</p>


<table style="width:auto;"><tr><td><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/mN-b5rxUc94YZKmIhmplDzOVRZNSpnbS6833kNhGsxs?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_aJ4urxfgN9A/TSulyKe9LOI/AAAAAAAAFaI/R6K_wh-wbTI/s400/SUC50026.JPG" height="300" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td style="font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:11px; text-align:right">From <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/krister.axel/TorontoNXNE2005?authkey=Gv1sRgCP_7xprJqP68nAE&feat=embedwebsite">Toronto NXNE 2005</a></td></tr></table>


<p>Below is the Canadian incarnation of Krister Axel, from right - Paul Sheehan / drums, Murray Foster / bass, Alo Paul's girlfriend (who gave emotional support), Mike Freas and I. Lavinia was with us and she took the picture.</p>

<p>We flew in on Friday, practiced Saturday afternoon and performed that night. It was truly inspiring the way we were received. the Canadians we met were all really cool and it was great to have so many people tell us that they really connected with the music. We laughed a lot this weekend. We made many new friends.</p>

<p>Toronto has a pretty unique sense of humor, almost everyone we met had us cracking up. I made some good contacts and I hope to get back over there soon. Coming back was sort of intense because my flight into LAX was delayed and I made it to the House of Blues for my show just a few minutes before Matty D, Mike Forrester and Mike Freas were going to figure out something to play without me. </p>


<p>It felt really good to park the car, walk right up and hit a nice 30 minute set. A good crowd, and I always love playing in the Foundation Room. I saw my friend Curtis Peoples who was there with Josh Kelly in the main room, Keaton Simons was on the bill and we traded cds. I love <a href="http://www.canofjam.com/" target="_top">Can of Jam</a> events, there's always a family vibe. See you at the beach in Hermosa! </p>


<p>be well </p>

<p>This was a perfect night.<br><br>

Everyone was there.<br>
It was like a family reunion. The energy of the crowd was electric and 
everyone was singing along to the point where I thought I was hearing voices.<br>
Check out this version on my new song I'm the Gun - this is where we had people screaming so loud they got picked
up in the mix from the onstage microphones that were facing the other way...<BR>

For those of you that aren't musicians, it is rare that you actually hear the crowd in a live recording unless you specifically put a microphone out in the crowd. In this case, everyone was so loud that that it didn't matter where the microphone was. :)
<BR>
<BR>
It was an honor to share the stage with Sally Jaye, Kyler England, LOONER and Jay Nash.<br>
A special thanks to all the guys in my band:<br>

Matt Delvecchio - bass, vocals
Mike Forrester - drums
Mike Freas - guitar
The Mighty Chet Dixon - harmonica, vocals
Curtis Byrd - drums<br>

<p>I submitted for a songwriting competition, and got invited to accept this award on the day after my birthday. </p>


<p>The <a href="http://www.stelmovillage.org/" target="_top">St. Elmos Village</a> / OG3 Records / Simply Songwriting Music Award. A show, a paperweight, and a cash prize. It was a great success, I felt really good about my set and the place was sort of magic. It was really warm,  not just the sunshine but the people. Everyone should know about this place, it's a center for creativity and positivity and they gave me this honor. </p>




<p>The whole weekend was a hit, from the 2 sets at the Lighthouse in Hermosa Beach to Sunday morning in San Diego and the afternoon in Los Angeles. The cds are selling. I love it. The guys in the band are so cool, we're just having a good time and working it out. We have a sweet sound, with Chet on harmonica singing harmonies with Matty D on bass and Mike Freas on guitar. Forrester was on vacation this weekend. Curtis Byrd played drums with us at the Lighthouse. Yeah.<br>

<p>I will wear it so well when I
  make it into the sunlight.
  Cold red lights
  a ghost
  
  in the room. singing
  It's a hard love
  sketching these thoughts
  at midnight in Nashville
  the smoke and the voices
  laying over me like

old brown paper</p>

  It was good to be on the road with my friends Zoe and Angel, and their little dog Ruby. We drove probably 5000 miles in 10 days. I sold a surprising amount of t-shirts and had a lot of fun playing solo, especially at this record store on Fayetteville called Sound Warehouse, I just brought my guitar and played on a bar stool in the middle of the store. That's what songwriting is all about, I felt like I was selling apples at a fruit stand. I walked into that place and the first thing he said was 'I have some vodka' so I could tell he was a friendly guy. He mixed me up a stoli and pop and I got to feeling pretty comfortable. A piano would have been way too loud for that little place so the guitar was perfect. Nice and simple. </p>
<p>This is the golf course we got to have our way with because our friend  works there. Arkansas is beautiful. We had it all to ourselves because it was closed that day. We drove around in golf carts drinking beer.</p>

<p>Fayetteville was my favorite because the people there are so cool, I made some good friends out there. Thanks Ryan!</p>
<p>I've got the Permanent Friday Night release scheduled for June 2nd at the Hotel Cafe, and I'll be getting back out on the road again pretty soon. Next weekend I'm in Hermosa Beach, and then San Diego in the morning and Los Angeles in the afternoon... I will be accepting a songwriting award for my song Ordinary. In a few more weeks, I'll be in Toronto, showcasing at the North by Northeast Music Festival.</p>
<p>enjoy the summer </p>

04.10.05 The Knitting Factory
<p class="style1">It's just a great stage, it reminds me of !st Ave in Minneapolis, the second tier with black steel handrails and very sparse lighting. Mysterious.</p>
<p class="style1">I didn't know we were playing in the main room until just before we started, and it felt great to have such sweet sound. We had space, we had eyes, we had sound. We had a reason.<br>
  The album goes out for printing on Monday, and I've got some amazing musicians on stage with me at my shows now. I started out playing solo at Highland Grounds and now I'm playing my songs with a 6-piece band at the Knitting Factory. I am blessed. <br>
  The Spring tour is booked except for a few dates, I'll be all over the US, mostly the Southeast and the West Coast. Some solo shows, some stripped-down band stuff. We'll just have to wait and see. The right things always happen at the right times.</p>
<p class="style1">This piece of verse is featured in the layout of Permanent Friday Night, which is taken from a poem I wrote to a friend of mine about two years ago. I spent a lot of time with with my good friend Timothy Norris working on the layout for this album, and I had a whole biography I wanted to put on the panel that I'm using for this poem. You know, 'I first had an idea for this album bla bla bla...' but I figured I'd spare y'all the details and get down to what I really mean.</p>
<p>be glad for that precious pain
there is poetry under your skin;

you are aware
of the human tragedy - that we fall
madly through time
towards death
and truth
in the span of 30,000 sunsets
with only love to guide us

  <br>
  All right. This was pretty serious. Background: 2 years ago I became very good friends with Sally and Joel from Paper Sun. I played with them in their band for about a year, and it was an amazing time. We sang some of the tightest 4-part harmonies you'll ever hear.</p>
<p class="style1">Fast forward to present time - we have continued to develop separate projects, and this was our first time on a bill together in some time. Some of my regular band members were out in Austin this past weekend, so I had to scrounge up a line-up sort of last minute and it was entirely dope. Jeramy Gritter on guitar - holy shit. Jazz vibe, great ear, knows exactly what time it is. Adam Marcello - drums, this guy is a legend in the making. The Mighty Chet Dixon - harmonica, backup vocals - the voice of Louisiana. Mike Forrester, percussion (with the sweet touch). Marc Regan, standup bass like a truck full of molasses. I loved this show so much, I am posting the mp3s right here so that everyone can hear how cool it was.</p>
<p class="style1">We played 5 songs in 40 minutes. It was beautiful. There's something about freedom, within music especially, that just gains momentum so unpredictably. I felt that on Sunday, like some big iron pendulum swinging across the bar, across this lobby of a forgotten hotel. I was among my own, these are the people I love. Jeramy said it himself, &quot;this is what happens when we get together.'</p>
<p class="style1">You see that? At 6pm on Sunday, I didn't even know who was playing. At 9pm, we had just finished our set. It was   a gift. </p>

<span class="style1">03.11.05 From Los Angeles, to New York, to San Francisco and back
</span>
<p class="style1">New York is a hell of a town. I loved it. Lavinia came with me, we stayed on the upper east side and walked through the Gates in central park - reminding me of a time in the 80's when I was a kid in Paris the same guy Christo wrapped up the Pont du Neuf in brown paper... </p>
<table style="width:auto;"><tr><td><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/CCVezH3yl0_pqWSR5REdew?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_aJ4urxfgN9A/TXdHzufmqEI/AAAAAAAAIsQ/GKXuhyBXuVk/s800/gatesnyc.jpg" height="160" width="240" /></a></td></tr><tr><td style="font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:11px; text-align:right">From <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/krister.axel/Stuff?feat=embedwebsite">stuff</a></td></tr></table>

<p class="style1">It was cold and full of taxis and after the show at Opaline we walked down the street to the Avenue A bar and drank too much whiskey the way you do when you know that someone else is driving... and your girl climbs onto your lap in the back of the cab on the way back to the hotel's 19th floor and you think to yourself, this is better than the movies... and then 3am finds you staring at the Queensboro bridge like a big truck outside the window - <br>
and as long as my heart still beats I am alive in these places, where the sun never shines through completely and the shadows look like nothing next to the dark heart of the city.<br>
You can wake up and be at the airport in an hour, waving a cup of coffee at the navy-blue shoes on the tarmac and get off in Oakland next to Laura Dern.</p>
<p class="style1">I sang for the  airport traffic, sang for the sky-caps and Laura Dern who wouldn't look at me but my ride came first so I never saw her face and it was a hot one that  Sunday in March with the taste of a New York latte still in my mouth... and the Hotel Utah, my sister's proud face and my old friends Carl and Chad... My rocker friends from Los Angeles (Janet Robin, Jen Alpert, Saucy Monky) shared the stage with me and it was a home away from home. My  friend Jenni took care of us in her house by the ocean and we felt loved. Two down.</p>
<p class="style1">We drove home in the mini-van, with breakfast bagel sandwiches and award-winning Russian coffee from a guy named Doug with a shop near Golden Gate park. Los Angeles was waiting for us like a spider's web where we drove around in circles dropping off guitars and we got stuck right in the middle, by the time I got home I had just enough time to get to Room 5 for my show with Chris Pierce and Joe Purdy and Gabriel Mann. Three down.</p>
<p class="style1">Two days later, we are out in Santa Monica where we can smell the ocean and it's a beautiful night, a woman buys me a drink before she even hears me play and we sound better than maybe ever... And the song I had written 4 hours before the gig was the best thing we played that night and it occurs to me that I love my Wurlitzer exactly where it is, waiting for me when I get home... and my voice sounds like honey and razor blades and I can't stop singing my own song back to myself before I go to sleep. </p>
<p class="style1"><hr>
<span class="style1">02.23.05</span>
<p class="style1">The Viper Room was pretty heavy. Lots of twisting and dancing and artificial smoke. It was as an occasion, to look out at the faces and know the best is yet to come. It rained like it was the end of the world that night, and you still couldn't see through the thick of it.Well done. </p>

<p class="style1">I am booking some great shows for this Spring. The future is bright. </p>
<p class="style1"><hr>
<span class="style1">02.19.05 </span>
<p class="style1">Only a few more weeks and I'll have the album done. I can't even believe it.
</p>
<p class="style1">It has been, no joke, almost 2 years since I started this thing. I can't possibly say how happy it makes me to have this album almost finished.</p>
<p class="style1">Matt Delvecchio has been an amazing help.</p>
<p class="style1">All the other guys in my band - Bart Ryan, Chet Dixon, Mike Forrester, Mike Freas, you guys rock. Stsy tuned for more news as it comes in. Right now, I've got the Viper Room to look forward to and in two more weeks I'll be in New York City!</p>

			        <p class="teaser_info"><p>I recently started journalling again, in the end of 2010. It feels good to get back to something I love. What is interesting is that as I am sifting through all of my old hard drives, both in order to migrate all of my blog posts to this new site and to finally do my backups into the cloud - as opposed to hard drives that have to be constantly synced and may fail at any moment - I am finding some great stuff. Old pictures that I thought I had lost, poems that I never published, songs and song ideas that never made it through the vetting process but in retrospect were pretty awesome and also some old pages of what were journal entries in the strictest sense. I was speaking directly to myself, with a deep sense of loneliness, regret and most of all pain. It is deeply personal stuff but for the most part harmless so I am posting it now in the hope that whoever reads it (if anyone) can keep an open mind. It is part of my struggle to be the best and most evolved person I know how to be. This period of journaling lasted from December of 2002 to February of 2004 and then just fell off a cliff. I'm not sure why I stopped - I think finally had a web site that I blogged on, and I seem to have picked back up <a href="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/2006/01/blog-entries-from-2005/">in early 2005</a>.</p>

<p>Anyway, there is a lot of craziness in here, the rantings of a chain-smoking, whiskey-drinking insomniac; but also some wisdom scattered about and clearly glimpses of a wounded soul coming to terms with life and what can only be referred to as truly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existentialism">Existential angst</a>.</p>

			        <p class="teaser_info"><p>Talk to me, I want to say to myself. What is going on in there?
I'm depressed. I don't know why, it doesn't make sense, I should be proud but I'm not. I've lost the fire; I don't know where it went.
I'm plagued with questions - what is best for me?
Why am I so concerned with time?
Have I accepted that I destined to be an introvert?
Am I nurturing my musical gifts correctly?
Why do I have such a nasty problem with insecurity?
Why are my relationships so short-lived?
What am I trying to do?
Am I just starved for love?</p>

<p>I feel like I don't have anything to say. I feel like I can't relate to people. For some reason, I feel like it's my fault for not learning how. At the same time, I am reminded on occasion that I am found to be very sexy by some people. It confounds me. I have very little love of self - which makes me sensitive to the fact that not everyone likes me. What the fuck is that?
I've got a real list of talents - musical, lyrical, physical, programmable…Why is it not enough? Why am I always looking for justification?
I have to start talking. I have got to get through this.
There's really no problem here. Everything is in place. I just have to start toeing it. Focus. This whole young man old man thing is over. I am where and what I am because of destiny. You have gift you must never waste it. I have made the right choices.
I want to get to the point where I don't feel like a failure. I know that sounds childish, but there it is.
Failure.
I fail every day - to impress, to intoxicate, to assimilate to regurgitate. To rejoice. To release.
I am completely cocooned.</p>

<p>It is now January 2004 and I am going to start writing again. Maybe it is merely the inability to write something positive that has kept me from it, I don't know. I just have to start keeping track of my thoughts like I used to.</p>

<p>I know I was not feeling very positive about everything. Not at all. I was disappointing myself, by being disappointed. I wish I could just do everything I want. At points, that would take at least two people, if not more. That's why I have to make decisions.</p>

<p>Ok, pros and cons. Pro: I would see Japan and Australia in the same trip. A ‘Pacific Rim' tour, as she said herself, and fuck did that sound good. Seeing the whole world in one year, in good hotels. Con: I would devastate a very good old friend, as well as few good new friends. Probably take a step backwards in my social arena, by not being around. Entirely and assuredly jeopardize my financial future in the middle to long term as far as having a steady income. Pro: this would be my first real pro gig, for good money as far as it lasts. An entry for the musical resume, with a good chance of landing nice endorsements and sponsorships. I would have to make a few good contacts on a tour like this. Con: the music is not great. Not terrible, but not great. Would NOT be a terribly hip endeavor.
I am scattered. Have been always. I have to quit smoking but I can't, want to be independent but not yet. I still have not found a way to really enjoy social interactions the way I should. My truest joys I still find alone.
Where does it leave me?
Trying to make the best of what could be a great opportunity, but the call of land unexplored is making me crazy. God, this love of guitar has all of a sudden diluted my destiny. I wanted to play with Alex so that I can be a better guitarist. Now, I have to decide between that and seeing the world, traveling, finding myself again. If only we had more than one chance.
I can't decide. I have to, it will be soon, but I am still crazy - Japan, in 5 or 6 weeks. How do you argue against that, food for the soul? Time alone, like I love.
But I made promises, to myself and to others. Finish what you start. Follow your instincts, the first ones. Do it for love.
So what do I love more: the world, or friendship? It's as simple as that. Everything else would fall into place, either way.
I did the math, and the chances of me making more or less the same are high, with a decent chance of actually making and keeping more money than I do now, until the end of the year. That's a long time. It could really be a different world by then, in ways I don't know.
But here's a con: I might really be on to something, with what I'm doing right now. Playing heavy rock guitar in a cool band, following the dream as I know it in one form; in my hometown, which could only be good thing for my own personal pursuits.
Oh but I love to be on the road. Even for a shit ass country band.</p>

<p>Lord give me strength.</p>

			        <p class="teaser_info"><p>What if I am invincible… These are questions for the oracle. I am still so new to myself, I don't yet understand, yet I am so close to it. I have become larger than I know. I have outstepped my own shadow and it is some astral projection, I have stars in my fingers and love in my breath and wisdom in my voice. It matters not that I have waited what could be considered a long time. I have arrived, again for the last time before I am awake, incensed and invincible.
Where I draw my energy from is what I suppose to be the same, cobblestone streets and legs with muscles. Coffee and traffic. Love and treason. The changing of seasons. The magic of a woman who traces runes on my shoulder.
And I believe now that it is sudden and visible, like a new color to the sky. I see faces that look at me differently, I am a master. I deserve to be studied. I am exactly what I should be, unafraid and disastrous, honest and direct. Impatient. I see so clearly now, I am everywhere I need to be and I understand the future in some hidden way, some music not meant for my conscious ears. I believe and I follow and I do not need to see the way, it is before me like the attraction of gravity, of warmth on a cold night.
I have outlined my own blueprint so that it is facile, it is in vivid, immediate memory. I run these races blindly with ulterior intentions and the outcome is the same, I am above.
I bring.</p>

<p>I bring what you are missing, what is nowhere else and what is mine. The essence of free thought and artistic will. The message of my blood and childhood. The beauty of my own existence.
And I am your friend, whoever you are. I respond to questions and I absorb the answers, I study what is foreign to me so that it is understood - and that is why I ask so little. I have brought my own advice. I stand in my own mentorship.
Because I have not found what I wanted in any other place but myself. I shine as my own star, as my own true north and I am grateful. I was not unwise. I am at the foot of a mountain of gifts - and they will all be accepted. I will receive and nurture all arts within my being.</p>

			        <p class="teaser_info"><p>I haven't written in a while.</p>

<p>I am thinking about eloquence, about the language that grew from Rilke at the letter writing table, who was my age in his first one. Only 100 years or so, and the very act of thinking has abbreviated itself. I see him as a sort of aristocrat, but I think this a misjudgment. Artists in those days were caught between society and poverty - with little to show for their efforts. I know not how he made his travels but I feel in my heart that he was not affluent at all.
And of course, the language between Van Gogh and Gauguin, in that long French script, with such literal discussion of physical form…
I have passed this legacy of Rilke on to a few now, and I believe that the world will benefit. I just want someone at some point to understand how much I have given to this, in such painless sacrifice - to the music, to the strings on a guitar, to the words on a page. It is no secret, anymore, to me - that solitude and the scrutiny of emotion are at the center of artistic focus… Rilke understood this, and led me also to understand. That one has only to look inward, at the sky within.
Awaken the sleeping voices, the opinions of ghosts and the noises of motion. The colors of metaphor, the magic of tension, the animals of the mind… I am now my own friend and muse, I direct my own consciousness and I heed inspiration above all else. I love my own voice, written and spoken in lustrous syllables. I elevate. I bring.
I am trying to lead now and this is new for me.
I give gifts, I am honorable. I shed light on what I can. I am open and honest, and for this I have recently finished being doubtful. There is far too little time to be what I am not… I have often decided on small adjustments and made them stick but for the most part I carry the same colors, the same patterns and the same stripes. I am utterly who I am and nothing besides that and I am grateful now for that identity… For as long as I can remember, I have been on the inside with myself, I have sensed my own desires and passions and commitments - my own rhythms of being and I have not faltered. God bless me, I have never lied to myself. About relationships and friendships and I have always held myself accountable to mercy, glory and defeat. You cannot take away from me that which guides me, it is a valley below me and a red-eyed sunset, the smoke from distant fires and a current from the ocean… It is the words that bring themselves to life like paper dolls on fire and become ashes before they take their first step…
It is love, love of my friends and my songs and their own cohabitation. I am in the hand of destiny who will write my name across the world in soft blue letters like the sky on paper. My songs will be heard by the coast, by the waves and the cars passing through in the California afternoon.
I will not lose my hope or my grip. These are the days of calculated mischief.</p>

<p>I met Jen on Thursday. Just before our show at O'Briens, Nicole Eadington sends me an email and tells me she wants me to meet her roommate. It was Misty's going away party- who looked amazing, as usual, and I vaguely remember her bending over to show me some cleavage and bending over in the other direction to show me her ass. Body language is so telling but I don't always read it… it's almost better that way, everything makes sense later.
Anyway, we sat and talked together the whole time… I went through two drinks, riveted by our own conversation. We talked about Europe, and art, her growing up in southern California, college (?) semester in Europe (Paris), private high school starts with an F…
That's it.
Tuesday, I call her, hey I called you at work on Saturday but you must have closed early because it was raining…
Nicole sends me another email, so are you taking Jen out on Thursday?
I call, she says says yes, I pick her up, we go to the liquid kitty.
Two drinks each - two kettle tonics for her, one rosebud cocktail and a magical Christian for me…
We talk about Europe, and art, and the war, it's just not the same anymore…
So hey, you wanna go see the ocean?
We're parking, no not the pier because it's completely sketchy…
We'll keep walking - except she has the wrong shoes - why not sit right here?</p>

<p>Neither of us have done this in a while, been so close to the moon and the ocean at the same time, quiet Santa Monica and the sound of waves…
We keep talking, and I lean in, ever so slightly.</p>

<p>It was very slight.</p>

<p>I immediately feel her face, next to mine, turning towards me, her hands come up and we are kissing, ferociously, and I'm proud I didn't smoke that day…
This continues, and I start squeezing her legs, the way I like to do, and she presses towards me, and there are very quiet noises, but I hear them… I start unzipping her pants, what Are you doing? And I say I don't know, until I find her clit with my fingers (silk front of her panties and she's completely smooth) at which point I say - thaaats what I'm looking for and she's moaning, and I reach around her ass with my other hand and can lift her, just a little, around my finger which doesn't go in but keeps knocking.
I think she came, in any case she said thank you (although that might have been for zipping her up) and she said that was just like high school and I think she meant it in a good way…
We kissed in the car for almost too long before she got out but that was after she invited me over the next night, because Nicole wasn't going to be there and that's why…
I just trimmed my pubic hairs gleefully in the mirror for the first time, I am 28 years old. Let me tell you the story.</p>

<p>3/21/03 8:28:22 PM</p>

<p>I'm getting dressed…
It takes me longer and longer… there's never anything left.
Show tonight… I came home this afternoon, and worked on the Early Ride to Vegas song. I love that I can do that - there was not much going on today.</p>

<p>And that whole craigslist ad was very successful… I only wish I tried it next week instead, but we'll see what the turnout is. It might even be better that I unleashed it a week early - I can always repost. It's nice to have new names on the list, and it makes for more hits on my website, at very least. I had fun answering all of the emails today… It's amazing, I was just thinking about how I used to fool around with Nicole donahough in Madison after bartime, and how we had to either meet up at the Plaza right at bar time, or I'd have to try and catch her when she just got home… otherwise there was no way to get in touch. We didn't have cell phones yet… how funny.</p>

<p>Heard a Curtis Mayfield song I could cover someday… track 7.
I could really work my falsetto, someday very soon, when I just altogether pull the plug on this smoking. My birthday is coming up, I should do it then… The world is all mine. I wonder if these solo shows will serve to really build some momentum. It's not entirely impossible…</p>

<p>Here are the songs I'm thinking of doing -</p>

<p>Get This Waiting
Tragic
Centerstone
When they take me in
Waterfall
Brooklyn
Try to listen
Dernier Coup
Won't Fade - but probably not</p>

<p>Maybes (if I can clean them up) -</p>

<p>Early ride to vegas
sometime</p>

<p>Something leads me where there are always surprises.</p>

<p>Last night I felt the earth move at 4am and I was writing. Even Los Angeles is lonely in the morning and it felt good, like exploring the unknown. I awake to find myself not very far from beauty, and I am proud. Joseph Arthur, no better than me. My songs are becoming small miracles.
And tonight, by the stars, I made Stephanie want me. She sang for me. :)
I am here, I have connections, next weekend in Vegas with Jenni. It is my world, in all it's contradiction. I am what I should be. Ryan wants to hear my music now. They are starting to come to me.
And this smoking… this blessed curse.
It is who I was, and who I am walking away from. My blues will follow me wherever I go. This speaking to no one, it is all I can do now. My voice is made, it is what it is. I write.
And I remember Jon talking about my use of metaphor. I appreciate what exists but forget what I create.. it is new, it is poetry. Follows birds across the ocean… I have arrived.
Look at me, with my arms around the world.</p>

			        <p class="teaser_info"><p>So maybe this is the crossroads. It does seem that good things like to happen simultaneously, as if to force a difficult decision. That's probably what amounts to resolve, the sense of direction, and fate.
I wish so much to see all things at once, but sadly I realize that I am only to understand what is necessary. My oldest addiction, the playing of music, makes itself known in many ways and I have learned nothing except that I want - or rather that I have - no control.
I will always be running back and forth, chasing paths that conflict in small ways, and I would give so much to have a glimpse at what I am building.
I understand that I am to be alone until something changes, until I feel like I can share all parts of myself. I fear to some degree that I would be judged, for my bad habits as well as my good ones, and I have yet to come to a conclusion about myself, as to what parts are worth defending… the obvious answer is that I should be proud of all that I am, which is for the most part true but there is always the feeling that I am less and have achieved less than what my fortune deserves. And that is at the root of it, this feeling that all that I have and all that I will be is somehow to be less than what my mind fashions. And from this I draw the anguish, the bitterness, and the wisdom that I am so small with such enormous designs. This is the starting point, and I will spread my wings as best I can.
Of all the truths that surround me, I choose to believe that I am great… that I have wandered through darkness very quickly, and my intuition serves me well.
I am thankful for the equation, for the balance of faith that belongs to me. I feel my own beauty like warm skin on these bones; a face that smiles back at me and will always have pride. I am a living potion, in equal parts red flame and white snow. My fathers before me stand tall, and my blood is alive with magic of the earth. I shape myself in the image of my ambition and I know that I am right to be obsessed. It is what is needed.</p>

<p>And everyone is just doing their thing…</p>

<p>I'm thinking of Chad, my old friend/enemy who moved to San Francisco and took his rock chick with him… I think of seeing Courtney, all decked out in ultra-modern trashy punk chic who I saw looking at fruit in Ralph's right off of Formosa with Vanessa on my arm; and look at us now. All separated, and shit.
I wonder if Korena will respond. If I had to put money on it - well, I won't say. I don't want to jinx it.
And I forget sometimes - it seems more often than not - but I still have it, I have this passion and this intensity… It's right at the point where I don't really give a shit anymore, that everything becomes easy again. I am living in a circle.
So tonight, I celebrated my own rediscovery. Another spin around the sun. French martinis - Frenchtinis - and a hell of a cheeseburger. With a salad afterwards -
because I don't want to lose sight. It's right when you get close that you lose hope. I could be right around the corner from another shift in the right direction.
I cannot hesitate any longer. I decide, I move, I reassess. My instincts have developed, I can fully trust myself… To really have the ability, I can be a guitar player - because I want to. It's all just a question of time.
I am moving in the right direction reasonably fast. This year, I think, will mean a lot. The world will finally know what I've been up to.</p>

<p>Love</p>

<p>I am awake. It is at any time that I may smile and forget. I am reminded of myself, the same map I still follow, and I wonder at the confusion I see around me. I have been so lucky, or wise somehow. Something that leads me knows many things. I have understood my surroundings, my tools, I have discovered myself. I write as I breathe, as I assemble small things together. Were these gifts, or victories? Why is it that I have such wealth of identity? I look at my life stretching out before me and I am unafraid. My decisions until now have been pure intuitions. Am I indeed en route to the musical utopia that I crave, or am I to serve some other peripheral cause? I have only the trust within, the casual blindness that I use to move quickly. I can only see what I choose - the steps that climb, the voices that sing and the depth of my hallucinations. The folds of beauty that fall from my fingers, which are learned habits that have disguised themselves as improvisational power.
So is this the scheme, the routes my muscles have traveled and the roads they have built? Do others find some shortcut of manufacturing, some assembly line that spits out blood? I am at times adorned with praise, but still I am no closer to this elevation. Maybe I am right to believe that true transcendence happens too quickly to notice. The edge of a precipice may seem all too level... I await this newness.
And this is how it happens, I am sure of it. I am every day closer to myself. I have torn down all the barriers to my own realization; there is nothing that stands before my own ritual and me.
So I build this thing - with care and wisdom, as I would have it. With the often supported truth that there is no way to share this vision. All that can be respected in this impatient world is the verdict, as faith has been supplanted by priority. All things must fall now between initiatives, as if good must be grown instead of nourished. As if beauty needs to be seen in order to be recognized.
And I don't believe that, in my heart. I am still clutching the fact that beauty IS. It does not mock itself for spectators, and it does not serve anything. Why should I direct my own impulses towards some ethereal target? Value is often assigned in retrospect, and all that I have now is preference. I prefer to follow my own leaders.</p>

<p>I prefer to believe in myself, not because I should but because I was born to.</p>

<p>This will be a triumph.</p>

01:13:04 AM</p>

<p>I'm the guy who doesn't know when to stop, or how to remove myself from the subject. I am always in character. It's all personal. Or I am looking past it, or to the side... My moments are genuine, and I respect the art of casual conversation, but I'm always looking for clues that hint to something bigger. Oh, so you're excited about THIS, what does that mean - why does that matter? Why am I listening? Which misses the point... I am a part of something, maybe just a moment between two people - and things progress naturally, that's a fact. But for some reason, I want to see a promise; I want flame, and madness. Or else I will improvise conceptually, I will wrap my own silence around the setting like an army of candles and peer across exaggerated distances. I will leave the room and come back, watching in slow motion as the exchanges of energy become fireworks... And not contribute a word. It is a tax I enforce. And just before it becomes obvious that I have been silent for some spell, I mention something trivial, as if my mind had been somewhere else... When, in fact, I have just been intensely aware of other-than-self. I have been in awe of the magic between humans.
And I see perhaps the alternate facts... The may-have-beens, the sad longings, and the silent understandings. The emotional contracts, and the web of possibles. So I surprise myself, and mesmerized by my own lack of impulse I form opinions, lingering forever in the middle. Somehow I admire the carriers of interest, the lines of thought through chaos that charge ahead with will, but I often see my peers, my friends, stumbling over the same things, as if they were in some mental darkness. It seems obvious to me that the path I seek has not yet been found, and that all comparison should defer to the future. I can only learn what not to do.
It occurs to me that my original tenets still hold true, most importantly the one that says 'true talent will always find it's way'; if I continue to distinguish myself from others, and build on the foundations that I have assembled there will never be a question of whether or not I was talkative enough. That seems absurd. I will always hold that one can only be so wise as to know oneself, and that is sufficient. Why would we seek to change our impulses without first knowing what they are? And that task itself needs a lifetime. I have been plagued and weakened by some doubt about my own personality, the energy I should offer so willingly to all that wish to see but it does not come naturally to me to be so consistent. I guess that's acting - feigned consistency. When I decide to act, I want it to be in a Hollywood class for beginners, not at a social audition. I still want honesty. I want to be recognized, not trivialized. I don't know what that means...
Except that I'm surprised how everyone finds a way to fit - even though most of it is for show. Even though so much discord lies just beneath the surface, like cockroaches, I still am amazed at how most of it is so pretty, this enormous pretension. We all live our lives with so little, such a limited view, such a narrow approach; and pleasure is so fleeting - hunger so complete, so consuming. Luck is a bad friend. Love doesn't always stay.
And then I am lost in a crowd of intentions.</p>

<p>And then I grow tired.</p>

<p>This is my first time.</p>

<p>It's like coming back after a long journey.</p>

<p>I am committed to bringing back the prose in my life. I remember having thought many times before, god, if only I could make the time to get used to writing a lot, often. There's so much I would say... I feel like I've had so much free time that gets wasted. I may be one of the most productive individuals in this universe, but of course by my own standards, there is so much left to accomplish. Maybe it's just the reformed slackers that later in life become so awkwardly motivated. It's like I'm still learning to walk.
But it does occur to me that so much in life that is reproachable stems from apathy, from inaction. I don't ever want to feel party to that. So maybe that's all that is important - caring. About anything... maybe this is just passion I feel, straight up like a shot of whiskey. Everything, in the end, has to do with whiskey.
I have known for some time now, that I have an addictive mind. I remember having said that if one is good, two is better... and so on. Of course I was talking about women - not necessarily group sex, I think it was in reference to giving gifts; but the premise is the same. I feel that, deep in my bones - the need to multiply what I love.
And now I am empowered. I have the tools, this new computer, and the world stretches out now like a long road waiting to be traveled. The people I see, the grails I chase and the bullets shooting past me are all short stories developing themselves. Every voice I've ever heard, and every decision I didn't make fast enough are now available for revisiting, for extension. I can imagine things I never did, and put words in anyone's mouth. I can give all of my pain justification.
Why is it that I only want to document the most cerebral chapter in the history of humanity that has somehow found itself fallen into a blonde cliche? Even as the majority of world citizens struggle with destiny itself, or at best let go completely of the sciences that have built their world, the sharp edge of innovation refines the human sphere to oligarchic orgasm. Am I not to stand in awe, pen ready? I wish to understand, to empathize towards the synthesis of a new emotion: awareness, the sterilized cocaine. A luxury.
To what end? As every writer follows a hidden signal... I want some rung in the ladder of human consciousness to be my namesake, nothing less. On this cold night, in the lap of lost memories with a view over the landscapes of destiny - in Los Angeles, on a street still thick with the air of decay my fate begins.</p>

<p>With short steps and long thought have I risen, and the moment approaches to accelerate. I have learned from others only what not to attempt. My ideas remain pure, as the dilution that comes from popularity has not surfaced. I give thanks often for my gifts of music, both given and received. The fruits of my retrospection have been simple affirmations. If destiny is not my friend then surely I am my own benefactor. I was ashamed to admit the extent of my compensation today... Among my own friends, I am often a stranger, of my own retreat. I will return in time.
Because there are no contemporaries for me. I have been dealt some ancient joker, and the value is uncertain but the prospect is good. I have been, for a long time now since a dark evening by the lake in Madison that I remember, rich in self-assurance. It is a warm wind that touches me sometimes and I follow it always. I am alone sometimes because of it, and I am not without my own serpents but the light is always visible. Even at night, when I am visited by doubt. I am not afraid of the silence.
Here is the course of the day, and the moments of exhaustion, and the flames of addiction. The pensive perch, and the mental engine. The gears of logic. The cloud of ennui, and the certainty that comes with a healthy bank account. It's all mine, the knowledge, the magic, the language and science of code that gives me such power. I found it all like a hunter and a thinker, with study and contemplation, and with a fair amount of deceit. I can see now how the past may be reconstructed for the greater good. I will make the world glad for its trust.</p>

<p>thank you</p>
