After the two exchange words, Zimmerman said, he reached for his cell phone, and then Martin punched him in the nose. Zimmerman said Martin pinned him to the ground and began slamming his head into the sidewalk.</blockquote><br />
<br />
Because any 17-year-old would want to put down the skittles, after having lost his pursuer, and re-engage the fat scary 28-year-old who had been chasing him by somehow pinning the much larger aggressor to the ground and slamming his head into the pavement. That makes about as much sense as the idea that if you were getting your head slammed into the pavement you would be somehow all better by the time you show up at the police station.<br />

<br />
Well, they do some really bad things. Here are some of the ways they manipulate findings to suit their limited interests:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<blockquote>One way that corporations prevent negative information about their products from getting out is by harassing scientists and the journals that publish them. Here's how Monsanto did it:<br />
<br />
Dr. Ingacio Chapela of the University of California-Berkeley and graduate student David Quist published an article in Nature showing that DNA from genetically modified corn was contaminating native Mexican corn. The research spurred immediate backlash. Nature received a number of letters to the editor, including several comments on the Internet from "Mary Murphy" and "Andura Smetacek" accusing the scientists of bias. The backlash prompted Nature to publish an editorial agreeing that the report should not have been published. However, investigators eventually discovered that the comments from Murphy and Smetacek originated with The Bivings Group, a public relations firm that specializes in online communications and had worked for Monstanto. Mary Murphy and Andura Smetacek were found to be fictional names.<br />
<br />
Corporations also form front organizations to hide their efforts to undermine science. That's what happened when producers of unhealthy food got together to cast doubt on the FDA's recommended health guidelines:<br />
<br />
The Center for Consumer Freedom is a nonprofit that targets dietary guidelines recommended by the FDA, other government agencies, medical associations, and consumer advocacy organizations. The center has run ads and owns a website that accuses government agencies of overregulation, and has published articles claiming to refute evidence that high salt intake and other dietary guidelines are based on inadequate science. The center was founded with a $600,000 grant from Philip Morris, but has also received funding from Cargill, National Steak and Poultry, Monsanto, Coca-Cola, and Sutter Home Winery.<br />
<br />
Sometimes corporations just go for it and buy off legit organizations, as Coca Cola did when they appear to have paid dentists to stop saying kids shouldn't drink Coke:<br />
<br />
In 2003, the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry accepted a $1 million donation from Coca-Cola. That year, the group claimed that "scientific evidence is certainly not clear on the exact role that soft drinks play in terms of children's oral disease." The statement directly contradicted the group's previous stance that "consumption of sugars in any beverage can be a significant factorâ€¦that contributes to the initiation and progression of dental caries."<br />
<br />
Corporations can also unduly influence federal agencies, as ReGen did when they wanted their device approved for trials by the FDA, despite serious medical problems:<br />
<br />
ReGen Biologics attempted to gain FDA approval for clinical trials of Menaflex, a device it developed to replace knee cartilage. After an FDA panel rejected the device, the company enlisted four members of Congress from its home state of New Jersey to influence the evaluation process. In December 2007, Senator Frank Lautenberg, Senator Robert Menendez, and Representative Steve Rothman wrote to FDA Commissioner Andrew von Eschenbach asking him to personally look into Menaflex. Soon thereafter, the commissioner met with ReGen executives and heeded the company's advice to have Dr. Daniel Shultz, head of the FDA's medical devices division, oversee a new review. The FDA fast-tracked and approved the product despite serious concerns from the scientific community.<br />
<br />
If bribery doesn't work, you can always censor negative results, the way pharmaceutical company Boots did:<br />
<br />
Boots commissioned Dr. Betty Dong, a scientist at the University of California-San Francisco, to test the effects of Synthroid, a replacement for thyroid hormone. Boots hoped to reveal that despite its high price, Synthroid was more effective than similar drugs. The company closely monitored the research, and when Dong found that the drug was no more effective than its competitors, instructed her not to publish the results. When she refused to comply, Boots threatened to sue. The company relented only after several years, during which consumers continued to pay for the costly product.<br />
<br />
You can also try "refuting" scientific results with bad evidence, the way the formaldehyde industry did:<br />
<br />
To counter a study that found that formaldehyde caused cancer in rats, a formaldehyde company commissioned its own study. That study-which found no association between the chemical and cancer-exposed only one-third the number of rats to formaldehyde for half as long as the original study. A formaldehyde association quickly publicized the results and argued before the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) that they indicated "no chronic health effects from exposure to the level of formaldehyde normally encountered in the home"<br />
<br />
And then, if you're Pfizer, you can just generate as much favorable research as you like to bolster sales of a drug, despite your discovery that the drug increases risk of suicide:<br />
<br />
From 1998 to 2007, Pfizer discreetly facilitated the publication of 15 case studies, six case reports, and nine letters to the editor to boost off-label use of Neurontin, a drug prescribed to treat seizures in people who have epilepsy and nerve pain. The number of patients taking the drug rose from 430,000 to 6 million, making it one of Pfizer's most profitable products. An investigation found that Pfizer had failed to publish negative results, selectively reported outcomes, and excluded specific patients from analysis. [Most importantly] Pfizer failed to note that the drug increased the risk of suicide.</blockquote><br />

			        <p class="teaser_info"><h3>The Strange History of the Teabagger Movement</h3><br />
<br />
This stuff is so rich. You really can't make it up - reality is so much stranger than fiction.<br />
<br />
The first big day for this movement was February 27, 2009. It was the beginnings of the Tea Party, what was then a fringe group funded mainly by <a href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Americans_for_Prosperity">Americans for Prosperity</a> and <a href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Freedom_Works">Freedom Works</a>. There was a young man there with a sign.<br/><br />
<a href="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/d4cd01573a2f6874e5e5f5a547893163.jpg"><img src="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/d4cd01573a2f6874e5e5f5a547893163.jpg" alt="" title="d4cd01573a2f6874e5e5f5a547893163" width="382" height="284" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-804" /></a><br />
<br />
The newly frescoed Tea Party was rearing up for a big protest on tax day - April 15th. In the run-up to that, Rachel Maddow <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLsKt4O4Yw8">had some fun</a> at their expense. This set off what can only be called a shit storm.<br/><br />
<a href="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Thank-You-Fox-News-for-Keeping-Us-Infromed.bmp"><img src="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Thank-You-Fox-News-for-Keeping-Us-Infromed.bmp" alt="" title="Thank-You-Fox-News-for-Keeping-Us-Infromed" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-805" /></a><br />

<br />
All of which made for some pretty silly signage from the linguistically challenged right-wing base. But it gets better.<br />
<br />
It's clear that somewhere within the eddies of spin and counter-spin, there was a real lack of homework done by whoever came up with the teabag idea in the first place. The amount of coverage it got was miraculous - and what was great is that you could see at the time that most of the talking heads had not gotten the memo about putting the kibosh on the term 'teabagger' - so it died a very slow death (at least in terms of modern media cycles) and the upshot was nothing short of hilarious.<br />
<a href="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/humble-libertarian-20090330.png"><img src="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/humble-libertarian-20090330.png" alt="" title="humble-libertarian-20090330" width="432" height="422" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-809" /></a><br />
<a href="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/prud-to-be-a-tea-bagger.png"><img src="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/prud-to-be-a-tea-bagger.png" alt="" title="prud-to-be-a-tea-bagger" width="387" height="428" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-810" /></a><br />
<br />
It was like watching a car crash in slow motion. Even some of our congresspeople (like Phil Gingrey) got in on the action.<br/><br />
<a href="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/philgrigngey-.png"><img src="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/philgrigngey--300x287.png" alt="" title="philgrigngey-" width="300" height="287" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-811" /></a><br />
<br />
Of course, within a few weeks of the Maddow piece the faux outrage and subsequent condemnation began in full force - a specialty of right-wing demagogues. The bullshit was flying fast and thick as the republican money machine was pulling all references to 'teabaggers' from the internets, and basically trying to make it look (as usual) like a liberal conspiracy. Within this time frame, there was a concerted effort to rebrand all teabaggers as 'tea partiers', and it was very effective. It was almost as if the original term had never existed. By the end of the year, redstate (a right wing blog) ran a piece that summed it up nicely.<br/><br />
<br />
<a href="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/redstate-20091110.png"><img src="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/redstate-20091110-504x1024.png" alt="" title="redstate-20091110" width="504" height="1024" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-813" /></a><br />
<br />
The best part of all of this is that in the final end game, the right has come back around and is now again embracing the 'teabagger' meme. First it was on, then it was a liberal conspiracy, then their hand was forced and they had to take it back from the liberals, so it's on again - sort of a nonsensical narrative but that should not be surprising. Anyway, now you have guys like Breitbart trying to again lay claim to the term in a sort of those-liberals-can't-get-their-minds-out-of-the-gutter kind of way. I'm slightly hesitant to <a href="http://biggovernment.com/abreitbart/2010/04/14/im-proud-to-be-a-tea-bagger/">link</a> to the video, but it really is absolutely priceless. Here are some screenshots:<br />

<br />
So that is the story of the term <strong>teabagger</strong> - first it had to do with a horribly repressive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_Act">import tax</a>, then 236 years went by, then it had to do with horribly naive demagoguery, then it was spun as a liberal conspiracy, and then it found its true place as a right wing meme.<br />

			        <p class="teaser_info">We really have a problem here.<br />
<br />
In the days of the Soviet Union, they had their State run news organs, Izvestia and Tass. These were pretty much propaganda organs, but they only had limited effect because the people knew it was propaganda. Today we here in the USA have a real problem on our hands because most people are inclined to think they aren't being lied to.<br />
<br />
I can't tell you how often I see these memes popping up - someone spouting propaganda as truth because they heard it on Glenn Beck, or FOX News, or whatever. We have completely lost the ability to think for ourselves in this country. I pride myself in always being ready, or at least open, to changing my opinion in the light of new evidence because there is so much bad information out there. But some people really only listen to certain voices coming from certain places and the real irony here, which is pretty much par for the course around the country, is that this guy (mentioned below) is defending the 1% that he is surely not a part of with a tired internet meme that dates as far back as 2004.<br />
<br />
It is explained <a href="http://www.truthorfiction.com/rumors/t/taxcuts.htm" target="_blank">here</a> that this silly analogy about how taxes are collected and why we shouldn't 'overtax the rich' - as if that is even remotely the case right now - has been attributed to two different economic 'scholars' neither of whom are taking credit for it. When I tried to explain the problems with his analogy I got this response which is really the heart of it:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>not my analogy, was written by T Davies professor of accounting and chair division of accounting and business law. University of south Dakota. Its not the Taxes that are unfair, its the wage disparity but thats the evil that comes with capitalism. Those who don't like it should go check out a socialist society, no one lives well or has any freedoms. The poor of this country still live better than 90% of the world</blockquote><br />
<br />
There is this concept of 'inevitability of evil' - as if we have no control. And then I got this:<br />
<br />
<blockquote><br />
 give me an example of a country with more than 200 mil people to make a fair comparison. size does matter. As well, europe seems to have its economic problems as well. A huge sovereign debt crisis is looming. As well I am not sure if the social model you are referring to really is Viable. I do recall some violent riots in france just this past october. I did not say I thought our system was fair, my point is that you can not solve the problems by simply taxing the rich.<br />
</blockquote><br />
<br />
Anyway, here's the meme:<br />
<br />
<blockquote><i><br />
Let's put tax cuts in terms everyone can understand.  <br />
Suppose that every  day, ten men go out for dinner. The bill for all ten comes to $100. If  they paid their bill the way we pay our taxes, it would go something like this:<br />
<br />
 * The first four men (the poorest) would pay nothing.<br />
 * The fifth would pay $1.<br />
 * The sixth would pay $3.<br />
 * The seventh $7.<br />
 * The eighth $12.<br />
 * The ninth $18.<br />
 * The tenth man (the richest) would pay $59.<br />
<br />
So, that's what they decided to do. The ten men ate dinner in the restaurant every day and seemed quite happy with the arrangement, until one day, the owner threw them a curve.<br />
<br />
"Since you are all such good customers," he said, "I'm going to reduce the cost of your daily meal by $20."<br />
<br />
So, now dinner for the ten only cost $80. The group still wanted to pay their bill the way we pay our taxes.<br />
<br />
So, the first four men were unaffected. They would still eat for free. But what about the other six, the paying customers? How could they divvy up the $20 windfall so that everyone would get his 'fair share'?<br />
<br />
The six men realized that $20 divided by six is $3.33. But if they subtracted that from everybody's share, then the<br />
fifth man and the sixth man would each end up being 'PAID' to eat their meal.<br />
<br />
So, the restaurant owner suggested that it would be fair to reduce each man's bill by roughly the same amount, and he proceeded to work out the amounts each should pay.<br />
<br />
 And so:<br />
<br />
 * The fifth man, like the first four, now paid nothing (100% savings).<br />
 * The sixth now paid $2 instead of $3 (33% savings).<br />
 * The seventh now paid $5 instead of $7 (28% savings).<br />
 * The eighth now paid $9 instead of $12 (25% savings).<br />
 * The ninth now paid $14 instead of $18 (22% savings).<br />
 * The tenth now paid $49 instead of $59 (16% savings).<br />
<br />
Each of the six was better off than before. And the first four continued to eat for free. But once outside the restaurant, the men began to compare their savings.<br />
<br />
"I only got a dollar out of the $20," declared the sixth man. He pointed to the tenth man "but he got $10!"<br />
<br />
"Yeah, that's right," exclaimed the fifth man. "I only saved a dollar, too. It's unfair that he got ten times more than me!"<br />
<br />
"That's true!!" shouted the seventh man. "Why should he get $10 back when I got only $2? The wealthy get all the breaks!"<br />
<br />
<br />
"Wait a minute," yelled the first four men in unison. "We didn't get anything at all. The system exploits the poor!"<br />
<br />
The nine men surrounded the tenth and beat him up.<br />
<br />
The next night the tenth man didn't show up for dinner, so the nine sat down and ate without him. But when it came time to pay the bill, they discovered something important. They didn't have enough money between all of them for<br />
even half of the bill!<br />
<br />
And that, boys and girls, journalists and college professors, is how our tax system works. The people who pay the highest taxes get the most benefit from a tax reduction. Tax them too much, attack them for being wealthy, and they<br />
just may not show up at the table anymore. There are lots of good restaurants in Europe and the Caribbean.</i><br />
</blockquote><br />
<br />
It's important to note that this attack response to a Facebook post of mine was totally unprovoked. He even added this at the beginning:<br />
<br />
<blockquote><br />
 How Taxes Work . . . the story of ten men going out to dinner representing how our tax system in the U.S. works... and why its not smart to continually overtax the rich?<br />
<br />
This is a VERY simple way to understand the tax laws. Read on -- it does make you think!!<br />
</blockquote><br />
<br />
The really sad part is that he was trying to 'help' me - he honestly thought I'd read that and say - 'wow, that is so astute. T Davies really helped me understand taxes!'.<br />
<br />
Here are the problems with this analogy.<br />
<br />
1 - the idea that the bottom 40% of wage-earners don't even pay taxes is demonstrably false. Also, there are things like payroll taxes that don't figure in, and there are things like sales tax that hit lower income people disproportionately - so believe me, poor people pay taxes.<br />
2 - The richest 10% control about <a href="http://motherjones.com/politics/2011/02/income-inequality-in-america-chart-graph">two thirds</a> of the wealth in this country, so if the richest guy in that silly analogy is only paying 59%, he is already paying less than his fair share - it should be closer to 66%.<br />
3 - It is a fact that the super-rich routinely pay comparatively less (percentage-wise) in taxes than their middle class counterparts.<br />
4 - The numbers are just totally off. Shouldn't he have wondered why a university professor didn't link any sources to back up his claim? You know, like a government report or something? We're just supposed to believe this guy, who doesn't really exist, about his numbers that have no source.<br />
<br />
So next time someone tries to pull out this tired analogy, bust them on it. <br />

EDIT: I just saw this guy at a wedding in NYC, and although we didn't speak, I did get some more info on him. Apparently, he is the heir to a rather large estate/fortune, so he has a dog in the fight as it were. For someone in the finance industry, it's a shame how clueless he is about taxes.<br />
