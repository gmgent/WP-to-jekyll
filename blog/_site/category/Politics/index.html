After the two exchange words, Zimmerman said, he reached for his cell phone, and then Martin punched him in the nose. Zimmerman said Martin pinned him to the ground and began slamming his head into the sidewalk.</blockquote>


<p>Because any 17-year-old would want to put down the skittles, after having lost his pursuer, and re-engage the fat scary 28-year-old who had been chasing him by somehow pinning the much larger aggressor to the ground and slamming his head into the pavement. That makes about as much sense as the idea that if you were getting your head slammed into the pavement you would be somehow all better by the time you show up at the police station.</p>

<p>Well, they do some really bad things. Here are some of the ways they manipulate findings to suit their limited interests:</p>

<blockquote>One way that corporations prevent negative information about their products from getting out is by harassing scientists and the journals that publish them. Here's how Monsanto did it:

Dr. Ingacio Chapela of the University of California-Berkeley and graduate student David Quist published an article in Nature showing that DNA from genetically modified corn was contaminating native Mexican corn. The research spurred immediate backlash. Nature received a number of letters to the editor, including several comments on the Internet from "Mary Murphy" and "Andura Smetacek" accusing the scientists of bias. The backlash prompted Nature to publish an editorial agreeing that the report should not have been published. However, investigators eventually discovered that the comments from Murphy and Smetacek originated with The Bivings Group, a public relations firm that specializes in online communications and had worked for Monstanto. Mary Murphy and Andura Smetacek were found to be fictional names.

Corporations also form front organizations to hide their efforts to undermine science. That's what happened when producers of unhealthy food got together to cast doubt on the FDA's recommended health guidelines:

The Center for Consumer Freedom is a nonprofit that targets dietary guidelines recommended by the FDA, other government agencies, medical associations, and consumer advocacy organizations. The center has run ads and owns a website that accuses government agencies of overregulation, and has published articles claiming to refute evidence that high salt intake and other dietary guidelines are based on inadequate science. The center was founded with a $600,000 grant from Philip Morris, but has also received funding from Cargill, National Steak and Poultry, Monsanto, Coca-Cola, and Sutter Home Winery.

Sometimes corporations just go for it and buy off legit organizations, as Coca Cola did when they appear to have paid dentists to stop saying kids shouldn't drink Coke:

In 2003, the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry accepted a $1 million donation from Coca-Cola. That year, the group claimed that "scientific evidence is certainly not clear on the exact role that soft drinks play in terms of children's oral disease." The statement directly contradicted the group's previous stance that "consumption of sugars in any beverage can be a significant factor…that contributes to the initiation and progression of dental caries."

Corporations can also unduly influence federal agencies, as ReGen did when they wanted their device approved for trials by the FDA, despite serious medical problems:

ReGen Biologics attempted to gain FDA approval for clinical trials of Menaflex, a device it developed to replace knee cartilage. After an FDA panel rejected the device, the company enlisted four members of Congress from its home state of New Jersey to influence the evaluation process. In December 2007, Senator Frank Lautenberg, Senator Robert Menendez, and Representative Steve Rothman wrote to FDA Commissioner Andrew von Eschenbach asking him to personally look into Menaflex. Soon thereafter, the commissioner met with ReGen executives and heeded the company's advice to have Dr. Daniel Shultz, head of the FDA's medical devices division, oversee a new review. The FDA fast-tracked and approved the product despite serious concerns from the scientific community.

If bribery doesn't work, you can always censor negative results, the way pharmaceutical company Boots did:

Boots commissioned Dr. Betty Dong, a scientist at the University of California-San Francisco, to test the effects of Synthroid, a replacement for thyroid hormone. Boots hoped to reveal that despite its high price, Synthroid was more effective than similar drugs. The company closely monitored the research, and when Dong found that the drug was no more effective than its competitors, instructed her not to publish the results. When she refused to comply, Boots threatened to sue. The company relented only after several years, during which consumers continued to pay for the costly product.

You can also try "refuting" scientific results with bad evidence, the way the formaldehyde industry did:

To counter a study that found that formaldehyde caused cancer in rats, a formaldehyde company commissioned its own study. That study-which found no association between the chemical and cancer-exposed only one-third the number of rats to formaldehyde for half as long as the original study. A formaldehyde association quickly publicized the results and argued before the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) that they indicated "no chronic health effects from exposure to the level of formaldehyde normally encountered in the home"

And then, if you're Pfizer, you can just generate as much favorable research as you like to bolster sales of a drug, despite your discovery that the drug increases risk of suicide:

From 1998 to 2007, Pfizer discreetly facilitated the publication of 15 case studies, six case reports, and nine letters to the editor to boost off-label use of Neurontin, a drug prescribed to treat seizures in people who have epilepsy and nerve pain. The number of patients taking the drug rose from 430,000 to 6 million, making it one of Pfizer's most profitable products. An investigation found that Pfizer had failed to publish negative results, selectively reported outcomes, and excluded specific patients from analysis. [Most importantly] Pfizer failed to note that the drug increased the risk of suicide.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(Latin for "you, too" or "you, also") or the appeal to hypocrisy, is a logical fallacy that attempts to discredit the opponent's position by asserting his failure to act consistently in accordance with that position; it attempts to show that a criticism or objection applies equally to the person making it. This dismisses someone's point of view based on criticism of the person's inconsistency, and not the position presented. Thus, it is a form of the ad hominem argument.</blockquote>


<p><strong>ruse</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>a wily subterfuge; an action or plan which is intended to deceive someone.</blockquote>


<p>As an example, here is a little exchange from the interwebs about so-called 'Slut-Gate'.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/tu-quoque.png"><img src="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/tu-quoque-253x300.png" alt="" title="tu-quoque" width="253" height="300" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1696" /></a></p>

<p><em>I apologize to America that the left, who specializes [sic] in throwing crass insults, can't take what they dish out.</em></p>

<p>This is it in a nutshell. Here is the angle: redirect the argument with a logical fallacy that circumvents the matter completely, and then proceed with a few unprovable statements:</p>

<p><em>political correctness is more important than dialogue</em></p>

<p>and finish up with some lies.</p>

<p>Calling someone a slut publicly is not 'dialogue'; political correctness, to my mind at least was always about terminology and a sort of collective awareness of our own multicultural and interpersonal sensitivities. This does fall somewhere squarely under the banner of misogyny but more importantly it just fails the basic test of human decency. Disrespect is disrespect.</p>

<p>The fact that both the <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2011/02/22/exclusive-militarys-persona-software-cost-millions-used-for-classified-social-media-activities/">military</a> and the private sector are pouring a lot of money every year into supporting 'anonymous voices' like this one here, is just as shameful as the hate speech of guys like Rush Limbaugh.</p>

<p>Those are some cluttered and wacky echo chambers out there, with a lot of manipulated consensus. I joke a little, and that is a very general statement, but the truth is that we don't know how big it is. All of that information is classified - but we do know that the national security budget is in the billions and there are plenty of think tanks out there with a lot of interest in manipulating public opinion.</p>

<p>It is so easy to redirect the conversation with a just a little bit of inflammatory hate speech, and I try to click through to view the profile of whoever it is when I see that stuff. Either they are 'anonymous' like the one I used an example, or they invariably just opened the account a month or two ago and they have a lot of comments on only a few blog posts. Our world is far more compassionate than the DOD and the oil lobby would have us believe. Ever since environmentalism met up with the cause of liberals there has been a systematic demonization of stinky hippies, tree-hugging liberals and really any sort of get-a-real-job artist types. It is not nice and it is not friendly. Here is a bad example:</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/liberals-are-not-humans.png"><img src="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/liberals-are-not-humans.png" alt="" title="liberals-are-not-humans" width="466" height="76" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1698" /></a></p>

<p>Is this what we have come to? Complete dehumanization of the other side? By my own argument, at worst this is nothing more than another false consensus but even as a page out of the playbook of these shadowy social media manipulators beholden to whatever corporate holy grail they may be it is some scary stuff.</p>

<p>UPDATE: also, the right wingers are just mean. <a href="http://axel.me/8o">Killing a cat and scrawling 'liberal' on it</a>? Show me one liberal nut job who would do something like that. The right wing is where crazies <em>live</em>.</p>

<p>You can see it online, there are <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=ows+punch&aq=f" target="_blank">plenty of Youtube versions</a>. It's amazing how documented this movement is. Just this week, we heard that <a href="http://axel.me/4f">mobile devices now outnumber people in the US</a>. I'm sure most of these devices have something resembling a camera and of course many of them probably also have some way to record video. No wonder many states are enacting laws that make taking video, photos, or audio of a police officer a crime. I would bet a lot of money that New York is trying pretty hard right now to ratchet up their existing law shielding police officers from video recordings. I have been <a href="http://axel.me/4g">saying it for years</a>: this is quickly becoming a police state. Does anyone remember the <a href="http://axel.me/4h">ongoing Posse Comitatus violation that started in 2008</a>? They announced it in the <a href="http://axel.me/4i">Army Times</a>, after all. This is a systemic problem and I think it is absolutely a corollary to the problems that we have now with the big banks. Any successful kleptocracy needs henchmen. There is a culture in media and government (both <a href="http://axel.me/4k">wholly owned subsidiaries of the corporations</a>) that protests like <strong>OccupyWallStreet</strong> are just full of hippies and <a href="http://axel.me/4j">'left-wing nutbars'</a> but somehow the Tea Party has nothing but legitimate concerns.</p>

<p>It's enough to make you feel a little crazy, like it's all slipping away and there is nothing to be done about it. I think that's why <strong>OccupyWallStreet</strong> is enjoying such widespread support - something the <a href=" http://axel.me/4">Tea Party</a> never had. Ever since Obama turned out to be such a disappointment, people have been waiting for somewhere to invest a little hope.</p>

<p>I have made donations at <a href="http://www.occupywallst.org/">occupywallst.org</a> and you should too. Anyone in the 99% - which is everyone, knowing how <a href="http://axel.me/4m" target="_blank">invisible the super-rich really are</a> - should get behind this movement. <strong>OccupyWallStreet</strong> is about putting some of the power back in the hands of the people, where it belongs. It's as simple as that.</p>

I've been seeing this quote moving around Facebook today and I should have realized it was becoming a national news item. The story is from <a href="http://mashable.com/2011/05/03/altered-mlk-quote/">Mashable</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Returning hate for hate multiplies hate, adding deeper darkness to a night already devoid of stars. Darkness cannot drive out darkness: only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate: only love can do that. Hate multiplies hate, violence multiplies violence, and toughness multiplies toughness in a descending spiral of destruction. So when Jesus says “Love your enemies,” he is setting forth a profound and ultimately inescapable admonition…. The chain reaction of evil — hate begetting hate, wars producing more wars — must be broken, or we shall be plunged into the dark abyss of annihilation.

- Martin Luther King</blockquote>


<p>A modified version of this quote has been going around Facebook:</p>

<blockquote><em>I mourn the loss of thousands of precious lives, but I will not rejoice in the death of one, not even an enemy.</em> Returning hate for hate multiplies hate, adding deeper darkness to a night already devoid of stars. Darkness cannot drive out darkness: only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate: only love can do that.</blockquote>


<p>The first sentence (in italics, added by me) was written by <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/jmadly/">Jessica Dovey</a>, and came to be included in a tweet by <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/pennjillette">@pennjillete</a> that quickly went viral. It was incorrectly attributed to MLK in it's entirety, although the first sentence was not his. I think the message is still an important one and I agree with the premise of both the entire quote from MLK as well as the modified one. The world needs love that is for sure.</p>

The fact that our government got away with the greatest feat of public deception of perhaps all time is a great source of shame for me and the discussion about 9/11 is non-existent. <strong>The only thing we know for sure is that were lied to about everything</strong>.</blockquote>


<p>Here is the original post:</p>

<hr>


<p>Dear Matt and Adam (two journalists that I respect very much) -</p>

<p>Both of you have shown me this week that you find it all right to ridicule 'truthers' on the basis of what could be called blood-in-the-water syndrome. I don't defend all or even most of what has been lumped together under this umbrella of the 'truther' movement, but I would expect the two of you to keep your critical thinking juices flowing for a little longer than you have. The fact is, although there is a real confluence of tinfoil-hat thinking within this group of 'truthers', there remains a core of people just like me who do not really pay much attention to people like Alex Jones, but who do have a problem with being lied to.</p>

<p>Now <strong>Matt</strong>, you of all people should know how disingenuous it can be for someone in a position like yours to make it seem like all that is similar is the same - in your <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/blogs/taibblog/truthers-fight-back-20110315">blog piece for Rolling Stone</a>, you refer to '9/11 Truthers' in a very insulting way:</p>

<blockquote>
Okay, so, predictably, the 9/11 Truthers came out of the woodwork kicking and screaming, after I compared them to my friend's brain-damaged dog. I know I said I would leave this stuff alone, but… I can't! It's just too maddening!</blockquote>


<p>First of all, in referring to all 'truthers' collectively, you might as well call all Christians Catholics. I know for a satirist like you, a big part of your stylistic approach to writing is precisely this sort of aggression, and frankly, when it is applied to Wall Street or the Tea Party I find it endearing. What bothers me about this is that these are your people, at least in some sense - there is some truth here, whether or not you want to see it. Again, there are some real fringe views that have unfortunately come under the 'truther' umbrella that I can't and will not vouch for - but the fact remains, we have clearly been lied to, and that should interest you. By your callous cheap-shot at an underappreciated quest by the few for political closure, you are undermining the causes that you purport to hold dear - namely the protection of the few against the many and the debunking of propaganda at all costs.</p>

<p><strong>Adam</strong> - I saw this <a href="http://twitter.com/AdamWeinstein/status/49292112130355200">tweet of yours</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Will I unfollow you for RTing some Alex Jones 9/11 truther bullshit? Why yes, yes I will. #EveryTime</blockquote>


<p>and I would make very much the same contention - that Alex Jones does not by any stretch of the imagination speak for the large group of people in this country that know that there is a story within the events of 9/11 that has not been told. You and Matt are by no means the only people that have made this mistake - but I single you out because you should know better. You have both been duped in some way into thinking negatively about something that should interest you - that's the only explanation I can come up with. That's what I mean by blood in the water - this meme that 'all truthers are crazy and have no salient point to make' is so prevalent that you have allowed yourselves to stop thinking critically. Please allow me to make a simple argument.</p>

<p>1 - Tower 7.</p>

<p>FEMA, in the <em>World Trade Center Building Performance Study</em>, Chapter 5, Section 6.2, referring to the "Probable Collapse Sequence" discussed in NPH 22 says that  it's own explanation for how WTC7 fell has only a "low probability of occurrence".</p>

<p>There is still no credible official explanation for why Tower 7 fell.</p>

<p>2 - Nano-thermite</p>

<p> Traces of nano-thermite have been found in 100% of the dust samples taken from ground zero. This is a smoking gun in terms of evidence of demolition at the site. These are not conspiracy-theory armchair historians muddying the water, this a respectable coalition of academics and scientists who have come this conclusion, and it deserves to be taken seriously. I copied the report pdf from www.benthamscience.com - <a href="http://kristeraxel.com/media/other/7TOCPJ-WorldTradeCenter.pdf">link</a></p>

<p>The simplest explanation is that we are being lied to. I make no claims about anything else - I don't know why they wanted Tower 7 to fall. I only know that we didn't get a credible explanation for how it happened.</p>

<p>I only ask that the two of you ask yourselves this question - do you ridicule 'truthers' because you have actually looked at this evidence and have deemed it baseless, or is there another explanation?</p>

<p>respectfully</p>

<p>Krister Axel</p>

			        <p class="teaser_info"><h3>The Strange History of the Teabagger Movement</h3>


<p>This stuff is so rich. You really can't make it up - reality is so much stranger than fiction.</p>

<p>The first big day for this movement was February 27, 2009. It was the beginnings of the Tea Party, what was then a fringe group funded mainly by <a href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Americans_for_Prosperity">Americans for Prosperity</a> and <a href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Freedom_Works">Freedom Works</a>. There was a young man there with a sign.<br/>
<a href="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/d4cd01573a2f6874e5e5f5a547893163.jpg"><img src="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/d4cd01573a2f6874e5e5f5a547893163.jpg" alt="" title="d4cd01573a2f6874e5e5f5a547893163" width="382" height="284" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-804" /></a></p>

<p>The newly frescoed Tea Party was rearing up for a big protest on tax day - April 15th. In the run-up to that, Rachel Maddow <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLsKt4O4Yw8">had some fun</a> at their expense. This set off what can only be called a shit storm.<br/>
<a href="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Thank-You-Fox-News-for-Keeping-Us-Infromed.bmp"><img src="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Thank-You-Fox-News-for-Keeping-Us-Infromed.bmp" alt="" title="Thank-You-Fox-News-for-Keeping-Us-Infromed" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-805" /></a>

<p>All of which made for some pretty silly signage from the linguistically challenged right-wing base. But it gets better.</p>

<p>It's clear that somewhere within the eddies of spin and counter-spin, there was a real lack of homework done by whoever came up with the teabag idea in the first place. The amount of coverage it got was miraculous - and what was great is that you could see at the time that most of the talking heads had not gotten the memo about putting the kibosh on the term 'teabagger' - so it died a very slow death (at least in terms of modern media cycles) and the upshot was nothing short of hilarious.
<a href="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/humble-libertarian-20090330.png"><img src="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/humble-libertarian-20090330.png" alt="" title="humble-libertarian-20090330" width="432" height="422" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-809" /></a>
<a href="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/prud-to-be-a-tea-bagger.png"><img src="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/prud-to-be-a-tea-bagger.png" alt="" title="prud-to-be-a-tea-bagger" width="387" height="428" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-810" /></a></p>

<p>It was like watching a car crash in slow motion. Even some of our congresspeople (like Phil Gingrey) got in on the action.<br/>
<a href="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/philgrigngey-.png"><img src="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/philgrigngey--300x287.png" alt="" title="philgrigngey-" width="300" height="287" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-811" /></a></p>

<p>Of course, within a few weeks of the Maddow piece the faux outrage and subsequent condemnation began in full force - a specialty of right-wing demagogues. The bullshit was flying fast and thick as the republican money machine was pulling all references to 'teabaggers' from the internets, and basically trying to make it look (as usual) like a liberal conspiracy. Within this time frame, there was a concerted effort to rebrand all teabaggers as 'tea partiers', and it was very effective. It was almost as if the original term had never existed. By the end of the year, redstate (a right wing blog) ran a piece that summed it up nicely.<br/></p>

<p><a href="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/redstate-20091110.png"><img src="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/redstate-20091110-504x1024.png" alt="" title="redstate-20091110" width="504" height="1024" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-813" /></a></p>

<p>The best part of all of this is that in the final end game, the right has come back around and is now again embracing the 'teabagger' meme. First it was on, then it was a liberal conspiracy, then their hand was forced and they had to take it back from the liberals, so it's on again - sort of a nonsensical narrative but that should not be surprising. Anyway, now you have guys like Breitbart trying to again lay claim to the term in a sort of those-liberals-can't-get-their-minds-out-of-the-gutter kind of way. I'm slightly hesitant to <a href="http://biggovernment.com/abreitbart/2010/04/14/im-proud-to-be-a-tea-bagger/">link</a> to the video, but it really is absolutely priceless. Here are some screenshots:</p>

<p>So that is the story of the term <strong>teabagger</strong> - first it had to do with a horribly repressive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_Act">import tax</a>, then 236 years went by, then it had to do with horribly naive demagoguery, then it was spun as a liberal conspiracy, and then it found its true place as a right wing meme.</p>

			        <p class="teaser_info"><p>We really have a problem here.</p>

<p>In the days of the Soviet Union, they had their State run news organs, Izvestia and Tass. These were pretty much propaganda organs, but they only had limited effect because the people knew it was propaganda. Today we here in the USA have a real problem on our hands because most people are inclined to think they aren't being lied to.</p>

<p>I can't tell you how often I see these memes popping up - someone spouting propaganda as truth because they heard it on Glenn Beck, or FOX News, or whatever. We have completely lost the ability to think for ourselves in this country. I pride myself in always being ready, or at least open, to changing my opinion in the light of new evidence because there is so much bad information out there. But some people really only listen to certain voices coming from certain places and the real irony here, which is pretty much par for the course around the country, is that this guy (mentioned below) is defending the 1% that he is surely not a part of with a tired internet meme that dates as far back as 2004.</p>

<p>It is explained <a href="http://www.truthorfiction.com/rumors/t/taxcuts.htm" target="_blank">here</a> that this silly analogy about how taxes are collected and why we shouldn't 'overtax the rich' - as if that is even remotely the case right now - has been attributed to two different economic 'scholars' neither of whom are taking credit for it. When I tried to explain the problems with his analogy I got this response which is really the heart of it:</p>

<blockquote>not my analogy, was written by T Davies professor of accounting and chair division of accounting and business law. University of south Dakota. Its not the Taxes that are unfair, its the wage disparity but thats the evil that comes with capitalism. Those who don't like it should go check out a socialist society, no one lives well or has any freedoms. The poor of this country still live better than 90% of the world</blockquote>


<p>There is this concept of 'inevitability of evil' - as if we have no control. And then I got this:</p>

<blockquote>
 give me an example of a country with more than 200 mil people to make a fair comparison. size does matter. As well, europe seems to have its economic problems as well. A huge sovereign debt crisis is looming. As well I am not sure if the social model you are referring to really is Viable. I do recall some violent riots in france just this past october. I did not say I thought our system was fair, my point is that you can not solve the problems by simply taxing the rich.
</blockquote>


<p>Anyway, here's the meme:</p>

<blockquote><i>
Let's put tax cuts in terms everyone can understand.  
Suppose that every  day, ten men go out for dinner. The bill for all ten comes to $100. If  they paid their bill the way we pay our taxes, it would go something like this:

 * The first four men (the poorest) would pay nothing.
 * The fifth would pay $1.
 * The sixth would pay $3.
 * The seventh $7.
 * The eighth $12.
 * The ninth $18.
 * The tenth man (the richest) would pay $59.

So, that's what they decided to do. The ten men ate dinner in the restaurant every day and seemed quite happy with the arrangement, until one day, the owner threw them a curve.

"Since you are all such good customers," he said, "I'm going to reduce the cost of your daily meal by $20."

So, now dinner for the ten only cost $80. The group still wanted to pay their bill the way we pay our taxes.

So, the first four men were unaffected. They would still eat for free. But what about the other six, the paying customers? How could they divvy up the $20 windfall so that everyone would get his 'fair share'?

The six men realized that $20 divided by six is $3.33. But if they subtracted that from everybody's share, then the
fifth man and the sixth man would each end up being 'PAID' to eat their meal.

So, the restaurant owner suggested that it would be fair to reduce each man's bill by roughly the same amount, and he proceeded to work out the amounts each should pay.

 And so:

 * The fifth man, like the first four, now paid nothing (100% savings).
 * The sixth now paid $2 instead of $3 (33% savings).
 * The seventh now paid $5 instead of $7 (28% savings).
 * The eighth now paid $9 instead of $12 (25% savings).
 * The ninth now paid $14 instead of $18 (22% savings).
 * The tenth now paid $49 instead of $59 (16% savings).

Each of the six was better off than before. And the first four continued to eat for free. But once outside the restaurant, the men began to compare their savings.

"I only got a dollar out of the $20," declared the sixth man. He pointed to the tenth man "but he got $10!"

"Yeah, that's right," exclaimed the fifth man. "I only saved a dollar, too. It's unfair that he got ten times more than me!"

"That's true!!" shouted the seventh man. "Why should he get $10 back when I got only $2? The wealthy get all the breaks!"


"Wait a minute," yelled the first four men in unison. "We didn't get anything at all. The system exploits the poor!"

The nine men surrounded the tenth and beat him up.

The next night the tenth man didn't show up for dinner, so the nine sat down and ate without him. But when it came time to pay the bill, they discovered something important. They didn't have enough money between all of them for
even half of the bill!

And that, boys and girls, journalists and college professors, is how our tax system works. The people who pay the highest taxes get the most benefit from a tax reduction. Tax them too much, attack them for being wealthy, and they
just may not show up at the table anymore. There are lots of good restaurants in Europe and the Caribbean.</i>
</blockquote>


<p>It's important to note that this attack response to a Facebook post of mine was totally unprovoked. He even added this at the beginning:</p>

<blockquote>
 How Taxes Work . . . the story of ten men going out to dinner representing how our tax system in the U.S. works... and why its not smart to continually overtax the rich?

This is a VERY simple way to understand the tax laws. Read on -- it does make you think!!
</blockquote>


<p>The really sad part is that he was trying to 'help' me - he honestly thought I'd read that and say - 'wow, that is so astute. T Davies really helped me understand taxes!'.</p>

<p>Here are the problems with this analogy.</p>

<p>1 - the idea that the bottom 40% of wage-earners don't even pay taxes is demonstrably false. Also, there are things like payroll taxes that don't figure in, and there are things like sales tax that hit lower income people disproportionately - so believe me, poor people pay taxes.
2 - The richest 10% control about <a href="http://motherjones.com/politics/2011/02/income-inequality-in-america-chart-graph">two thirds</a> of the wealth in this country, so if the richest guy in that silly analogy is only paying 59%, he is already paying less than his fair share - it should be closer to 66%.
3 - It is a fact that the super-rich routinely pay comparatively less (percentage-wise) in taxes than their middle class counterparts.
4 - The numbers are just totally off. Shouldn't he have wondered why a university professor didn't link any sources to back up his claim? You know, like a government report or something? We're just supposed to believe this guy, who doesn't really exist, about his numbers that have no source.</p>

<p>So next time someone tries to pull out this tired analogy, bust them on it.</p>

<p>EDIT: I just saw this guy at a wedding in NYC, and although we didn't speak, I did get some more info on him. Apparently, he is the heir to a rather large estate/fortune, so he has a dog in the fight as it were. For someone in the finance industry, it's a shame how clueless he is about taxes.</p>

<p>quoted:</p>


<p>The maker of the sights, Trijicon, has a $660 million multi-year contract to provide up to 800,000 sights to the Marine Corps, and additional contracts to provide sights to the U.S. Army. </p>


<p>John 8:12, referred to on the gun sights as JN8:12, reads, "Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life."</p>


<p>Trijicon confirmed to ABCNews.com that it adds the biblical codes to the sights sold to the U.S. military.</p>

<p>"The trickle-down theory can be examined using the tools of econometrics. But, at least for the US, no such sophisticated analysis is required. The raw data on income distribution shows that households in the bottom half of the income distribution gained nothing from the decades of market liberalism. Although apologists for market liberalism have offered various arguments to suggest that the raw data gives the wrong impression, none of these arguments stand up to scrutiny. All the evidence supports the commonsense conclusion that policies designed to benefit the rich at the expense of the poor have done precisely that."</p>
