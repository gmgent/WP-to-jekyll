<hr />

<p>You don't want to be
alone in a storm with me
you don't want to be
lost at sea with me</p>

<p>you might love me
you might care
you might need me
somewhere</p>

<p>you don't want to be
chasing stars with me
you don't want to be
hiding your heart from me</p>

<p>you might love me
you might care
you might need me
somewhere</p>

<p>somewhere, somewhere
you might need me somewhere</p>

<p>Added vocals by Lindsey Harper.</p>

<hr />

<p>When I walked through the door
with the wine in my hands
and a smile on my face
like a child
the weekend would fade
but then something would change
and we'd be here
together again</p>

<p>I waited up
I shined the light
I found the truth
and I made it right</p>

<p>there's a place I believe
where the sky meets the sea
where we both can be free to hold on
and this place I can see
where we both need to be
is where the sky meets the sea and holds on
so baby hold on to me
where the sky meets the sea</p>

<p>this show must go on
because there's nothing so strong
as the force
of a billion desires
we lose everyone
to the bass and the drums
and the voices
that just feed the fire</p>

<p>I waited up
I shined the light
I found the truth
and I made it right</p>

<p>there's a place I believe
where the sky meets the sea
where we both can be free to hold on
and this place I can see
where we both need to be
is where the sky meets the sea and holds on
so baby hold on to me
where the sky meets the sea</p>

<p>when I walk through the door
with a hand in my hand
and a kiss from the girl
that I love
we never look back
at the broken down tracks
and the troubles
that we overcome</p>

<p>there's a place I believe
where the sky meets the sea
where we both can be free to hold on
so baby hold on
hold on
hold on
hold on to me
where the sky meets the sea</p>

							    <p class="teaser_info"><p><a href="http://kristeraxel.com/media/2012-kristeraxel-AllTiedUp.mp3">This</a> (All Tied Up) was recorded at THe Village Studios in Santa Monica, what a great session that was. I played all of the instruments except for Scotty added some drums and cajone. My wife loved this song after I assured her it was written about nothing specific.</p>

<hr />

<p>All tied up, nowhere left to go but down
you turn your world around
burning down the house
when everything goes south
you change your state
find a place to go away
and try to love again
choice is not a sin
when someone lets you in
I know you're hurt
I know you're hurt</p>

<p>we take what's good and we take what's right
we break our toys and don't think twice
we hold our breath and don't know why
but it's over, it's over
has it been so long since the day we were born
because I feel so much is all but gone
so I hold my head I don't look back
but it's over, it's over</p>

<p>it's over now, it's over now</p>

<p>All tied up and something in my head won't budge
I'm changing all my ways
I'm counting up the days
the ones we didn't hate
it's over now and so we say again - you're out
and someone else is in
we don't know where they've been
but choice is not a sin</p>

<p>we take what's good and we take what's right
we break our toys and don't think twice
we hold our breath and don't know why
but it's over, it's over
has it been so long since the day we were born
because I feel so much is all but gone
so I hold my head I don't look back
and it's over, it's over</p>

<p>it's over now, it's over now
it's over now, it's over now</p>

<p>Sweet Thing</p>

<p>I was the revolution
you were the liberation
that falls from a pregnant sky
set loose on a Friday night
I know what you do to me
you give love in these little pieces
saving for a rainy day
I think you should give it away</p>

<p>Sweet thing, sweet thing
all you get is nothing
sweet thing, sweet thing
all you get is nothing when you put nothing in</p>

<p>she's high on the running away
here tonight and gone the next day
sweet like a candy girl
lasts as long as a dirty word
soft like a butterfly
hot like a brushfire
don't make me fall in love
if you don't want to be the one</p>

<p>Sweet thing, sweet thing
all you get is nothing</p>

<p>Yeah, yeah and you're feeling so much better
you're feeling so much better
Yeah, yeah and you're feeling so much better
you're feeling so much better</p>

<p>Sweet thing, sweet thing
all you get is nothing
sweet thing, sweet thing
all you get is nothing when you put nothing in</p>
