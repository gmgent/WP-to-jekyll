<p>Revolver was the first band I played with in Los Angeles. Those were some good years, I only got to LA in 1999 so this is just after I arrived. This pic might be from the Coach and Horses, if I remember correctly.</p>

			        <p class="teaser_info"><p>This is a great lesson in why one must google oneself every now and again. I do this somewhere between every month and every quarter - both to verify my own SEO efforts but also to eavesdrop on anyone who is posting stuff on the internets about me. Sometimes, you find new things that you don't expect. Like that one time I found a whole album of live shots from a <a href="http://axel.me/3r" target="_blank">Hotel Cafe show</a> that I forget even existed.</p>

<p>Today, at the top of page 27 of my google search for 'Krister Axel review', I found this.</p>

<p>[caption id="attachment_1289" align="aligncenter" width="300" caption="John Popper jams with Krister Axel"]<a href="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/JohnPopper_1240018778.jpg"><img src="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/JohnPopper_1240018778-300x225.jpg" alt="" title="JohnPopper_1240018778" width="300" height="225" class="size-medium wp-image-1289" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>Yup, that is a really great shot of me jamming with the one and only John Popper. This was taken at South by Southwest in Austin, Texas around March of 2006. I was performing a set at the <a href="http://www.one2onebar.com/" target="_blank">One-2-One bar</a> (love that place) and in the middle of <a href="http://axelradio.com/track/southern-girl" target="_blank">Southern Girl</a>, John Popper hears the music through the window, likes it, walks in, someone hands him a microphone and he jams along. The timing was priceless. He took my solo for me. :)</p>

<p>So as it turns out, my friends over at One-2-One must have taken the picture, and are using it as one of their <a href="http://www.reverbnation.com/page_object/page_object_photos/venue_89531" target="_blank">profile photos with ReverbNation</a>. Thankfully someone put my name in the caption and google found it. Awesome.</p>

			        <p class="teaser_info"><p>Reductio ad absurdum is a mode of argumentation that seeks to establish a contention by deriving an absurdity from its denial, thus arguing that a thesis must be accepted because its rejection would be untenable. It is a style of reasoning that has been employed throughout the history of mathematics and philosophy from classical antiquity onwards.</p>


<p>A classic instance of reductio reasoning in Greek mathematics relates to the discovery by Pythagoras - disclosed to the chagrin of his associates by Hippasus of Metapontum in the fifth century BC - of the incommensurability of the diagonal of a square with its sides.</p>

			        <p class="teaser_info"><p>Well, here I am finally writing an actual blog update. I've been tweeting a lot, and posting code/geek stuff on <a href="http://codeboxer.com" target="_blank">codeboxer.com</a>, but not a lot of personal updates. I'm still preparing to release some new music, but I don't have an album cover yet. I am completely out of touch with almost everyone I know, due to a pretty long string of bad phone experiences (theft, not working, etc.) and some tough times at work that leave me feeling a little too angry about the world to reach out at all. But that seems to be changing, bit by bit. Of course I am still completely enamored with my beautiful wife and next year sometime we are going to start a family, so there is a lot to look forward to.</p>


<p>I have been slinging database code for 10 years now, and Ruby on Rails for over 3. What a life this has been so far. In a horrible economy, I managed to pick a career that is still woefully short on good talent and I am very grateful for that.</p>


<p>Tomorrow, I start working from home which is basically a dream come true.</p>


<p>I know I have been slacking a little in terms of releasing music, but I still have some new tracks available<a href="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/2010/04/on-sale-now-at-emusic-amazon-and-rhapsody/"  target="_blank"><here</a> that are new and most of y'all haven't heard.</here</a></a></p>


<p>I am also really excited about 'Pain &amp; Joy', which will be my newest release once I can get someone to do an awesome album cover for me.</p>


<p>Finally, you can hear a sneak preview from the upcoming release at my podcast - <a href="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/RockStarAlley/"  target="_blank">here</a> .</p>


<p>later!</p>

<p>The link may not work forever. It is a fascinating discussion about God. The two camps are:</p>


<p>1 - Jesus is totally real, duh!<br />
2 - Do you even know what a plethora is?</p>


<p>Guess which camp I'm in! I've heard it said best like this (paraphrased, and mind the sarcasm):</p>


<p>"Oh, so Superman, we totally made that up. And the X-Men, that also didn't really happen. Godzilla, also a myth. But Jesus? He's real!"</p>


<p>_______</p>


<p>The one common thread I've found in ALL of my seeking is this: humanity has an inborn desire to be connected to Divine source or nature, somehow- something other, or larger than one-self, or the individual awareness, such as the Collective Unconscious of Carl Jung's description, the Cosmic Consciousness of the New Agers, or whatever you prefer to call it.</p>


<p>Without belief or faith in SOMETHING, existence is simply not possible. This is why I find it more credible to believe that there is an intelligent order of design in the universe, which is fractal in nature (apply the science of mathematics here!) and recursive, as well as spiral and cyclic. Our own minds support this theory because we systemize data according to some kind of intelligent order. Our brains have to interpret our perceptions somehow, even though individual interpretation can and very often is often completely fallible. That, to me, does not suggest 'accidental' development if the universe is in fact fractal in nature.</p>


<p>Most religion, to me, is simply crap because it is only man-made interpretation of what man's 'animal-mind' perceives about divinity or other forces that it cannot otherwise explain. Try explaining plasma energy to an amoeba, if you could somehow communicate with the amoeba. See if the amoeba does not 'deify' you if it could be proven the amoeba has the qualities of the human psyche.</p>


<p>My latest conclusion is this- everything is INTERCONNECTED, and this is an UNAVOIDABLE fact- we all exist on the SAME 'playing field' since all matter is energy at its most basic elemental makeup, and energy has been proven scientifically to be indestructable. Atomic cohesions can be broken into smaller elements, but they can be broken down no further than their most basic makeup, which of course, is ENERGY in a myriad of different configurations.</p>


<p>If the Universe is therefore made up of LIGHT (energy), then the LIGHT must be intelligent and aware, and an active principle in the continuing evolution of universal existence. Whether we 'anthropomorphize' this force or not in our attempt to 'create God in our own image' is largely not a consideration, since the human species is likely only a fractional division of the life extant within the vastness of the universe. It would be arrogant of us to assume otherwise in light of what science has observed thus far.</p>


<p>But we ARE here for a reason, and I don't believe it was through an 'accidental' occurrence that's been labeled as the 'big bang'. I personally believe that we are meant to evolve to a much higher level of consciousness (existence, awareness, reality) than where we are now. Maybe that makes me sound like a New Ager, but so be it.</p>


<p>Then again, we may all be like rats trapped in a huge maze, some "meta-experiment" gone wrong and then abandoned by the 'experimenter', but even at that, there must still be a way OUT of the maze- some doorway or exit that very few but the smartest or most aware find.</p>


<p>If nothing else, then one must AT THE VERY LEAST have a belief or faith in ONE-SELF, or we might as well 'shut the whole thing down'! Get out the nukes and 'have at it' once and for all!</p>


<p>These conclusions are NOT based on any mythology, other than the value that said mythologies have at presenting the most common elements with other systematized schemata from world history.</p>

_____</p>


<p>One of my wife's distant friends has attempted to invite herself to stay with us, again. She did this last March, and we used the excuse of me starting a new job and needing to do x, y, and z as well as the "out of town" excuse for any remaining dates. This got us off scot-free, but we both knew the time would come again... and it's here. We need a final solution.</p>


<p>We live in a small 2 bedroom apartment, in New York City. People like to visit here, and they don't generally want to pay for a hotel. We understand this. However, we also don't want people staying with us who we don't know or don't like.</p>


<p>My wife received the following email (summarized):</p>


<p><i>I'm going to be in NYC the night of the 5th to the morning of the 15th for [blah blah blah some work-related singing event thing]. Maria (my boss) said it is on the lower east side at Gramercy Park. I do have another friend who offered me her place to stay, but not for the whole time. Is there a chance that I could stay with you and Jeff for a portion of that time? I'd be using the subway the whole time and I'd be gone from 10-10 probably every day, so I'd be out of your way most of the time. Let me know if this might be a possibility! Your choice on the dates, it's pretty flexible when I stay at her place. Thanks for your help - I hope this works out so we can see each other!<br />
</i><br />
Oh my god. First, I don't even know this woman. I've never even spoken with her. My wife doesn't really like her, but she's one of those people who just won't go away. To complicate things further, my wife is one of those people who doesn't really like to say no or to turn away people from her past, so I'm sure this woman will be following us wherever we go. Granted, they do have history in that they used to go to school together from ages 11-16. A decade ago. Then, they've seen each other sporadically when they've been home at the same time. This complicates the issue a little since it begs the question "does past history automatically equate to present friendship?" Even so, I'm reluctant to allow her stay because it'll set a precedent and possibly ruin the (slim) chances of her just fading into the past, and never hearing from her again.</p>


<p>Further, it really annoys me when people just invite themselves over, or present the possibility of you accommodating them. This is something I strive never to do. If anything, I might "test the waters" by mentioning I'll be in town, and see if an offer comes my way, but suggesting that you should allow me to stay in your apartment with you and your significant other whom I have not met seems borderline if not downright rude. Presumptuous, definitely.</p>


<p>I doubt this will be the last time this happens, so we need a final solution.</p>


<p>The only thing I've thought of so far are:</p>


<p>1. Our apartment has a weird key (true), and we haven't been able to get it duplicated (somewhat true). We need our keys (true). Sorry.</p>


<p>2. Keep it vague. "Sorry, that isn't going to work for us" seems like a pretty good solution, but a) it's still pretty awkward to say to someone, especially since I wouldn't put it beyond this woman to inquire further -- "Why, though? Why can't I stay?" -- and b) it'll be hard to get my wife to say this to her.</p>


<p>Have you had similar experiences? What would you do in this sort of situation? Is getting cornered into an unfortunate situation like this just a fact of life I'm refusing to accept? </p>


<p>and the response:<br />
________</p>


<p>This is a classic case of Ask Culture meets Guess Culture.</p>


<p>In some families, you grow up with the expectation that it's OK to ask for anything at all, but you gotta realize you might get no for an answer. This is Ask Culture.</p>


<p>In Guess Culture, you avoid putting a request into words unless you're pretty sure the answer will be yes. Guess Culture depends on a tight net of shared expectations. A key skill is putting out delicate feelers. If you do this with enough subtlety, you won't even have to make the request directly; you'll get an offer. Even then, the offer may be genuine or pro forma; it takes yet more skill and delicacy to discern whether you should accept.</p>


<p>All kinds of problems spring up around the edges. If you're a Guess Culture person -- and you obviously are -- then unwelcome requests from Ask Culture people seem presumptuous and out of line, and you're likely to feel angry, uncomfortable, and manipulated.</p>


<p>If you're an Ask Culture person, Guess Culture behavior can seem incomprehensible, inconsistent, and rife with passive aggression.</p>


<p>Obviously she's an Ask and you're a Guess. (I'm a Guess too. Let me tell you, it's great for, say, reading nuanced and subtle novels; not so great for, say, dating and getting raises.)</p>


<p>Thing is, Guess behaviors only work among a subset of other Guess people -- ones who share a fairly specific set of expectations and signalling techniques. The farther you get from your own family and friends and subculture, the more you'll have to embrace Ask behavior. Otherwise you'll spend your life in a cloud of mild outrage at (pace Moomin fans) the Cluelessness of Everyone.</p>


<p>As you read through the responses to this question, you can easily see who the Guess and the Ask commenters are. It's an interesting exercise.<br />

<p>EDIT: some key comments added:</p>

<p>It's really interesting that so many people think the request isn't rude. I think it's rude, or maybe a better word is pushy, to ask someone for a favor a second time after you've already been turned down once. I feel like the first refusal is the unspoken social signal that we hope people pick up on so that they don't put us in the position of having to be rude and say no a second time to a request for a favor.
There's a lot of good advice about different ways of saying no - if it were me and I did want to have some future contact (but not a house guest), I would go with "No, we can't , have a great visit, let me know if you have time to meet up, etc..."

<p>Wow, gt2 -- I couldn't have asked for a clearer demo of Guess-type thinking, complete with the assumption that you should never "put [people] in the position of having to be rude and say no" -- italics mine.</p>

<p>For comparably unmistakable Ask-type responses, see dobbs and tkolar.</p>

<hr>


<p>WTF? How on earth is this person being rude? Her email sounds quite polite to me. Your interpretation of it, however, is downright ghastly. Of course, just say no to her question, but crikey, don't blame her for asking it as it's perfectly reasonable. She probably has no idea you dislike her so which isn't surprising based on your post.

<p>Get over it. There's nothing rude about asking to crash at someone's place, particularly in your mid-twenties.</p>

<p>Is getting cornered into an unfortunate situation like this just a fact of life I'm refusing to accept?</p>

<p>The only unfortunate thing in this situation is the fact that your wife doesn't appear to be able to say "sorry, no" to someone asking a favor. That is a fact of life that you had better learn to accept.

<p>and then both Mike Freas and Marlon Grace played with me on "I'm the Gun". When I got off stage, Jackson Browne gave me a compliment about my songs and I was stunned. I still am. Jackson played a really great song called "All Good Things Come To An End" and that was one of the best nights of my life.</p>

<p>Back in the 7th grade for a time my friends and I got into Dungeons and Dragons. Our DM made the mistake of thinking that it could be cool to give us a magic book that contained all the spells of all levels that we could read and cast at any time. I admit, it was kinda fun, since we basically became invincible. But it became a huge headache for the DM since we could disintegrate anything he threw at us, and he eventually found a way of taking it away from us. Sigh.</p>

<p>Tumblr now is my vehicle for blog posts and I'll just copy over the same copy every time I write something. It's not ideal but it will work for now until I find time to automate the re-posts. At the end of the day, I spend way more time writing it than anything else. The reason I like Tumblr is that it will automate the tweets and the Facebook posts, and that saves me a lot of time right there.</p>

<p>"The trickle-down theory can be examined using the tools of econometrics. But, at least for the US, no such sophisticated analysis is required. The raw data on income distribution shows that households in the bottom half of the income distribution gained nothing from the decades of market liberalism. Although apologists for market liberalism have offered various arguments to suggest that the raw data gives the wrong impression, none of these arguments stand up to scrutiny. All the evidence supports the commonsense conclusion that policies designed to benefit the rich at the expense of the poor have done precisely that."</p>

<p>If that isn't bad enough, Wall Street is poised to make billions of dollars in the “trade” part of cap-and-trade. The market for trading permits to emit carbon appears likely to be loosely regulated, to be open to speculators and to include derivatives. All the profits of this pollution trading system would be extracted from the public via increased energy prices.</p>


<p>There is a better alternative, one that would be more efficient and less costly than cap and trade: “fee and dividend.” Under this approach, a gradually rising carbon fee would be collected at the mine or port of entry for each fossil fuel (coal, oil and gas). The fee would be uniform, a certain number of dollars per ton of carbon dioxide in the fuel. The public would not directly pay any fee, but the price of goods would rise in proportion to how much carbon-emitting fuel is used in their production.</p>

<p>'It is my job to point out that many of the same people who bear direct responsibility for the financial crisis were given positions of great power in the Obama White House, and that in many important ways the Obama appointments represented a resounding reaffirmation of the status quo (I didn't even mention the renomination of Ben Bernanke), and the exact opposite of “change.” One can argue about the extent to which this is true, but I don't think the facts are really in question.'</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — Sarah Palin's new book reprises familiar claims from the 2008 presidential campaign that haven't become any truer over time.<br />
Ignoring substantial parts of her record if not the facts, she depicts herself as a frugal traveler on the taxpayer's dime, a reformer without ties to powerful interests and a politician roguishly indifferent to high ambition.<br />
Palin goes adrift, at times, on more contemporary issues, too. She criticizes President Barack Obama for pushing through a bailout package that actually was achieved by his Republican predecessor George W. Bush - a package she seemed to support at the time.<br />
A look at some of her statements in "Going Rogue," obtained by The Associated Press in advance of its release Tuesday:<br />
___<br />
PALIN: Says she made frugality a point when traveling on state business as Alaska governor, asking "only" for reasonably priced rooms and not "often" going for the "high-end, robe-and-slippers" hotels.<br />
THE FACTS: Although travel records indicate she usually opted for less-pricey hotels while governor, Palin and daughter Bristol stayed five days and four nights at the $707.29-per-night Essex House luxury hotel (robes and slippers come standard) overlooking New York City's Central Park for a five-hour women's leadership conference in October 2007. With air fare, the cost to Alaska was well over $3,000. Event organizers said Palin asked if she could bring her daughter. The governor billed her state more than $20,000 for her children's travel, including to events where they had not been invited, and in some cases later amended expense reports to specify that they had been on official business.<br />
PALIN: Boasts that she ran her campaign for governor on small donations, mostly from first-time givers, and turned back large checks from big donors if her campaign perceived a conflict of interest.<br />
THE FACTS: Of the roughly $1.3 million she raised for her primary and general election campaigns for governor, more than half came from people and political action committees giving at least $500, according to an AP analysis of her campaign finance reports. The maximum that individual donors could give was $1,000; $2,000 for a PAC.<br />
Of the rest, about $76,000 came from Republican Party committees.<br />
She accepted $1,000 each from a state senator and his wife in the weeks after the two Republican lawmakers' offices were raided by the FBI as part of an investigation into a powerful Alaska oilfield services company. After AP reported those donations during the presidential campaign, she said she would give a comparative sum to charity after the general election in 2010, a date set by state election laws.<br />
PALIN: Rails against taxpayer-financed bailouts, which she attributes to Obama. She recounts telling daughter Bristol that to succeed in business, "you'll have to be brave enough to fail."<br />
THE FACTS: Palin is blurring the lines between Obama's stimulus plan - a $787 billion package of tax cuts, state aid, social programs and government contracts - and the federal bailout that Republican presidential candidate John McCain voted for and President George W. Bush signed.<br />
Palin's views on bailouts appeared to evolve as McCain's vice presidential running mate. In September 2008, she said "taxpayers cannot be looked to as the bailout, as the solution, to the problems on Wall Street." A week later, she said "ultimately what the bailout does is help those who are concerned about the health care reform that is needed to help shore up our economy."<br />
During the vice presidential debate in October, Palin praised McCain for being "instrumental in bringing folks together" to pass the $700 billion bailout. After that, she said "it is a time of crisis and government did have to step in."<br />
___<br />
PALIN: Says Ronald Reagan faced an even worse recession than the one that appears to be ending now, and "showed us how to get out of one. If you want real job growth, cut capital gains taxes and slay the death tax once and for all."<br />
THE FACTS: The estate tax, which some call the death tax, was not repealed under Reagan and capital gains taxes are lower now than when Reagan was president.<br />
Economists overwhelmingly say the current recession is far worse. The recession Reagan faced lasted for 16 months; this one is in its 23rd month. The recession of the early 1980s did not have a financial meltdown. Unemployment peaked at 10.8 percent, worse than the October 2009 high of 10.2 percent, but the jobless rate is still expected to climb.<br />
___<br />
PALIN: She says her team overseeing the development of a natural gas pipeline set up an open, competitive bidding process that allowed any company to compete for the right to build a 1,715-mile pipeline to bring natural gas from Alaska to the Lower 48.<br />
THE FACTS: Palin characterized the pipeline deal the same way before an AP investigation found her team crafted terms that favored only a few independent pipeline companies and ultimately benefited a company with ties to her administration, TransCanada Corp. Despite promises and legal guidance not to talk directly with potential bidders during the process, Palin had meetings or phone calls with nearly every major candidate, including TransCanada.<br />
___<br />
PALIN: Criticizes an aide to her predecessor, Gov. Frank Murkowski, for a conflict of interest because the aide represented the state in negotiations over a gas pipeline and then left to work as a handsomely paid lobbyist for ExxonMobil. Palin asserts her administration ended all such arrangements, shoving a wedge in the revolving door between special interests and the state capital.<br />
THE FACTS: Palin ignores her own "revolving door" issue in office; the leader of her own pipeline team was a former lobbyist for a subsidiary of TransCanada, the company that ended up winning the rights to build the pipeline.<br />
___<br />
PALIN: Writes about a city councilman in Wasilla, Alaska, who owned a garbage truck company and tried to push through an ordinance requiring residents of new subdivisions to pay for trash removal instead of taking it to the dump for free - this to illustrate conflicts of interest she stood against as a public servant.<br />
THE FACTS: As Wasilla mayor, Palin pressed for a special zoning exception so she could sell her family's $327,000 house, then did not keep a promise to remove a potential fire hazard on the property.<br />
She asked the city council to loosen rules for snow machine races when she and her husband owned a snow machine store, and cast a tie-breaking vote to exempt taxes on aircraft when her father-in-law owned one. But she stepped away from the table in 1997 when the council considered a grant for the Iron Dog snow machine race in which her husband competes.<br />
___<br />
PALIN: Says Obama has admitted that the climate change policy he seeks will cause people's electricity bills to "skyrocket."<br />
THE FACTS: She correctly quotes a comment attributed to Obama in January 2008, when he told San Francisco Chronicle editors that under his cap-and-trade climate proposal, "electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket" as utilities are forced to retrofit coal burning power plants to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.<br />
Obama has argued since then that climate legislation can blunt the cost to consumers. Democratic legislation now before Congress calls for a variety of measures aimed at mitigating consumer costs. Several studies predict average household costs probably would be $100 to $145 a year.<br />
___<br />
PALIN: Welcomes last year's Supreme Court decision deciding punitive damages for victims of the nation's largest oil spill tragedy, the Exxon Valdez disaster, stating it had taken 20 years to achieve victory. As governor, she says, she'd had the state argue in favor of the victims, and she says the court's ruling went "in favor of the people." Finally, she writes, Alaskans could recover some of their losses.<br />
THE FACTS: That response is at odds with her reaction at the time to the ruling, which resolved the long-running case by reducing punitive damages for victims to $500 million from $2.5 billion. Environmentalists and plaintiffs' lawyers decried the ruling as a slap at the victims and Palin herself said she was "extremely disappointed." She said the justices had gutted a jury decision favoring higher damage awards, the Anchorage Daily News reported. "It's tragic that so many Alaska fishermen and their families have had their lives put on hold waiting for this decision," she said, noting many had died "while waiting for justice."<br />
___<br />
PALIN: Describing her resistance to federal stimulus money, Palin describes Alaska as a practical, libertarian haven of independent Americans who don't want "help" from government busybodies.<br />
THE FACTS: Alaska is also one of the states most dependent on federal subsidies, receiving much more assistance from Washington than it pays in federal taxes. A study for the nonpartisan Tax Foundation found that in 2005, the state received $1.84 for every dollar it sent to Washington.<br />
___<br />
PALIN: Says she tried to talk about national security and energy independence in her interview with Vogue magazine but the interviewer wanted her to pivot from hydropower to high fashion.<br />
THE FACTS are somewhat in dispute. Vogue contributing editor Rebecca Johnson said Palin did not go on about hydropower. "She just kept talking about drilling for oil."<br />
___<br />
PALIN: "Was it ambition? I didn't think so. Ambition drives; purpose beckons." Throughout the book, Palin cites altruistic reasons for running for office, and for leaving early as Alaska governor.<br />
THE FACTS: Few politicians own up to wanting high office for the power and prestige of it, and in this respect, Palin fits the conventional mold. But "Going Rogue" has all the characteristics of a pre-campaign manifesto, the requisite autobiography of the future candidate.<br />

<p>Plus, the public plan won't cover abortion care. While plans participating in the health insurance exchange are legally permitted to offer a version of the plan that does cover abortion--enrollment limited to those who pay for the entire plan without any subsidy--it's unlikely plans will go the extra mile to offer that coverage...</p>

<p>by Michael Barone, 'Senior Political Analyst'. Ha! more like, 'Senior Political Jackass'.</p>


<p>The gist is, there was a story about how 'green' groups are disagreeing over how much to offer 'light-on-climate' ads in their public messages - i.e., do we give it to them straight or sugar coat a little so as to not scare anyone into looking the other way - not a bad consideration, in my view. So one party says, we should just 'have faith' in our public that they can handle the truth.</p>


<p>And from this, Michael Barone somehow thinks by asserting that we should 'have faith in the American public' that it equates with there being no 'concrete proof' on global warming; and furthermore by making this erroneous conclusion he has convinced himself that he has somehow categorically refuted the premise that global warming even exists.</p>


<p>Sheesh. Hey Michael Barone - maybe you should work at FOX. They love bullshitters like you. Plus, you're just dumb enough for them to hire. </p>

<p>Sample Letters to Support NCEA ACRE in the Field</p>


<p>NCEA ACRE Sample letter to Parents for Individual Student Reports. Used with permission. There will be additional letters forthcoming as permission is granted for them to appear.</p>


<p>December 3, 2001</p>


<p>Dear Parents,</p>


<p>Your Notre Dame senior recently took the ACRE (Assessment of Catechesis Religious Education) survey. ACRE assesses faith knowledge and the affective domains of beliefs, attitudes, practices, and perceptions. Your child's individual results are included with this letter.</p>


<p>These individual results were sent directly to me and are not part of your child's academic file. The individual results will not be seen by any faculty or staff member of the school or Diocese, and will not influence any course grade.</p>


<p>ACRE was administered to seniors in both Diocesan high schools and to all fifth and eighth graders in our elementary schools. There were two purposes to the administration of this survey: to provide students and their parents with an understanding of the student's faith development and to provide the schools with group data. Each school will use the group data (no names indicated) to ascertain strengths and weaknesses in their religion curriculum. In addition, the Office of Catholic Schools will analyze the group data from all schools as part of a needs assessment for curriculum development. The goal is to improve the religious education and the religious experience of each student.</p>


<p>I am very pleased to announce that the group data for Notre Dame students, both Catholic and non-Catholic, is very good. Our students have a firm understanding of their faith. This is due to you, the parents as the primary educators, your church, the elementary schools, and to Notre Dame's teachers. Thank you for all your support.</p>


<p>Sincerely,</p>


<p>Jo Dean Salley, Ph.D.<br />
Principal</p>

<p>So here we are, a year out from when Sivers sold CDBaby to Discmakers. The whole thing has gone to shyte. The links don't work, my albums are showing up randomly and inconsistently across different digital networks.</p>


<p>All of my options are locked now, meaning nothing can change. Horrible. I guess all good things go away eventually. CD Baby used to be really the best ever. Now, they totally suck.</p>


<p>It is possible that if you are a new client it works fine, but I have 4 albums distributed with them and the user experience for me went from from A+ to a D-. So sad.</p>


<p>Oh Derek - why did you abandon us?</p>


<p>Discmakers sucks. Bring back the old CD Baby. Please. I have had so many problems already! Does anyone know an easy way to port my whole CD Baby catalog to somewhere else?</p>

<p>Yet, even if we think in that sort of outdated terminology, First, Second and Third World, and most Americans do, then America is a Second World nation. We have no universal free health care (don't kid yourself about the plan under way), no guarantee of anything really, except competitive struggle with one another for work and money and career status -- if you are one of those conditioned to think of your job and feudal debt enslavement as a "career" -- high infant-mortality rates, abysmal educational scores, poor diet, no national public transportation system, crumbling infrastructure, a collapsed economy. Even by our own definition we are a Second World nation.</p>

quoted:</p>


<p> Banks have been silent partners in the meteoric rise of the Federal Housing Administration.</p>


<p>In the past year, the nation's financial institutions have snapped up securities backed by Ginnie Mae, a government-owned agency that guarantees payments on mortgages backed by the FHA. That helped drive demand for Ginnie securities and created an outlet for billions of dollars of FHA-backed loans made to borrowers who in many cases couldn't afford big down payments.</p>


<p>As of June 30, the roughly 8,500 federally insured banks and thrifts were holding $113.5 billion of Ginnie securities, compared with just $41 billion a year earlier...</p>


<p>************************</p>


<p>plus few notes from the blogosphere:</p>


<p>"The irony is that banks that are reluctant to lend and are trying to unload their own mortgage holdings are at the same time helping to prop up the housing market by buying up securities backed by mortgages."</p>


<p>That's not the half of it. Banks are also USING the FHA programs as a way to unload their mortgage holdings, by refinancing mortgages on their books into FHA or agency programs.</p>


<p>The banks could very well be buying back mortgages from the same borrowers who were on their books, except this time wrapped with full faith and credit protection from the government.</p>


<p>The whole mortgage finance industry in this country is a scam.</p>


<p>____</p>


<p>More unintended consequences of well-meaning but misguided regulations.</p>


<p>Risk-based capital rules classify government-guaranteed mortgages as "risk-free," so banks don't have to hold any capital against such assets. This means that banks can lever up on these mortgages, earning assets that require no capital back-up.</p>


<p>In so doing, banks provide an outlet for GNMA to sell off the "new subprime" garbage being underwritten by FHA, just at CDOs were used to sell off the "old subprime" garbage underwritten by Countrywide and Washington Mutual.</p>


<p>Without securitization, we wouldn't have had the subprime bubble that started this crisis. Without securitization, FHA couldn't continue the madness.</p>


<p>These are incredibly risky mortgages.</p>


<p>The risk is all being borne by the U.S. taxpayer.</p>


<p>___</p>


<p>and:</p>


<p>This was NOT unintended. They FHA know exactly what they were doing.(with blessings all around) And don't be surprised if we see even a further expansion of the FHA underwriting guidelines to ensnare an ever bigger amount of dead loans sitting on bank balance sheets.</p>


<p>These banks full well know that the easy FHA guidelines represent the best exit strategy for their troubled loans on thier balance sheet. And while the last bonafide resi securitizations were May '07, since then, banks have accumulated their share of resi loans on their balance sheet that they'd gladly jettison off to FHA land.</p>


<p>And there are those special servicers too that are trying to convert their loans to FHA. Remember, don't be surprised if FHA eligible dollar amounts start creeping up higher....</p>


<p>Short of just giving these banks money, (they are finding this more difficult these days) the alchemists of economics sitting in DC are out of bullets. They are out of ideas. They are soon to be flirting with a $$ that could start to question their open checkbook, and quantifiable and unquantifiable healthcare deficits.</p>


<p>Expect FHA guidelines to easy, elibible dollar amounts to rise. All politically sellable, and quite intentional.</p>

<p>Yup, as if we were in a bizarro world, Obama just won the Nobel Peace Prize.</p>


<p>For the first time in a long time, I find myself agreeing with Republicans on this. I just don't feel that he deserves it. Granted, most of my issues with him have to deal with domestic policy, but still there are things that spill over into the world stage that he is responsible for that are antithetic to a 'Peace Prize'.</p>


<p>1 - Guantanamo is not closed. Furthermore, there is evidence that we are still routinely torturing 'terrorists' and claiming 'state secrets' to avoid investigation. Where's the peace in that?</p>

<p>2 - We are still in Iraq and Afghanistan. Where's the peace in that?</p>

<p>3 - Obama has made the Israel/Palestine conflict worse, not better, by stocking his cabinet full of AIPAC members without a single Palestinian advocate.</p>


<p><a href="http://tpmcafe.talkingpointsmemo.com/2009/09/20/steve_walt_aipac_still_thwarting_obama_on_middle_e/" title="http://tpmcafe.talkingpointsmemo.com/2009/09/20/steve_walt_aipac_still_thwarting_obama_on_middle_e/">http://tpmcafe.talkingpointsmemo.com/2009/09/20/steve_walt_aipac_still_t...</a></p>

<p>4 - Finally, the mistake Obama made to fill all his Finance positions with Goldman Sachs cronies and ex-Bushies was a slap in the face to Progressive movements everywhere. The corporate handouts have been obscene, and the foul play has been absolutely obvious. The fact that Obama (and his hatchet-man Geithner) have papered over the problem (pun intended) as opposed to attacking the source of it is undeniable and shameful. Where, I ask, is the peace in that?</p>


<p><a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/26793903/the_big_takeover" title="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/26793903/the_big_takeover">http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/26793903/the_big_takeover</a></p>


<p>The only convincing argument I've heard is that the Nobel committee is trying to 'encourage' Obama to continue in his 'pursuits'. All I can say to that is: don't we do that with children? Give them rewards to 'encourage' them?</p>


<p>Real adults get rewarded for results, not pursuits. I am saddened by the Nobel committee, and I agree with many bloggers out there - the only honorable thing to do is give it back. He may yet earn it, and I am pulling for him - but it is way too early to give the prize to him now. There were 200+ other names on that list - I guarantee that there were some REALLY deserving names on there that could have used the money and the publicity to push their agenda along. What a monumental loss of an opportunity.</p>


<p>Ah well - good on ya, Barack, for gaming the system. Here's hoping you live up to what was once a powerful legacy.</p>


<p>My vote would have gone to Greg Mortenson, or someone like him - currently low-profile, and could use some publicity for a simple and solid mission. </p>

<p>Despite the claims of economic recovery, the combined total of 834,000 workers either losing their jobs or giving up the search for work is comparable to the 700,000-plus job losses recorded in January and February.</p>


<p>September marked the 21st consecutive monthly decline in jobs—the longest continuous drop in US employment since the Labor Department began collecting such figures in 1939.</p>


<p>Some 15 million American workers are unemployed, nearly double the number out of work when the recession began at the end of 2007. The average duration of unemployment is 26.2 weeks, more than half a year, the highest figure since the Labor Department began such statistics in 1948. One third of the unemployed, more than five million, have been out of work for 27 weeks or more. This is another Labor Department record.</p>


<p>...</p>


<p>Maintaining unemployment at the highest levels since the Great Depression is a deliberate policy of both big business parties and the ruling class as a whole.</p>


<p>While Democratic politicians and union bureaucrats invariably blame the economic collapse, particularly in manufacturing, on foreign competition and imports, the jobs crisis is of global dimensions. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which groups the 30 largest industrialized nations, the jobless rate for all 30 countries will approach 10 percent in 2010—just about the projected average for the United States. Some 57 million people will be out of work by the end of next year—a number equivalent to the total population of France, Italy or South Korea.</p>


<p>The jobs crisis demonstrates the failure of the capitalist system—not only in the United States, but internationally. Not a single capitalist government, in any of the OECD countries, has lifted a finger to create jobs or put the unemployed to work. In each country, the ruling elite is using mass unemployment as a club against the working class, to enforce demands for the destruction of wages, benefits and working conditions.</p>

			        <p class="teaser_info"><p>Very interesting - quoted from <a href="http://esciencenews.com/articles/2009/09/28/the.skinny.lean.education" title="http://esciencenews.com/articles/2009/09/28/the.skinny.lean.education">http://esciencenews.com/articles/2009/09/28/the.skinny.lean.education</a> :</p>


<p>There are several key principles of Lean thinking that can be adapted to adult education and online learning, Alagaraja explains:</p>


<p>    * Cellular processes: allow chunking of coursework so that it can be taught as valid, standalone sub-units of a complete whole.<br />
    * Policy deployment: is a strategic planning process that correlates the purpose of a course with objectives and activities.<br />
    * Flow: encourages learner ownership so that they can dwell on a topic or move along more swiftly depending on their understanding.<br />
    * Just-in-time: provides feedback on projects in time for discussion in next class session/meeting.<br />
    * "Kaizen": Allows educators to adapt the course to learner feedback.<br />
    * "Kanban": Offers learners timely feedback on their mistakes so that they can correct their understanding quickly and effectively.<br />
    * "Poka-yoke": Is mistake proofing, which involves standardizing the syllabus to prevent recurrent problems.<br />
    * "Quality function deployment": Incorporates learner needs into the design and updating of the course content.<br />
    * Standardization: Simplifies assignments to meet learner requirements.<br />
    * Theory of constraints: Identifies barriers, such as technological limitations, and removes them.<br />
    * Throughput: Designs assignments with real-life relevance.<br />
    * Value stream mapping, visual controls, and visual management: Provides a map of the course flow.<br />
    * Waste elimination: Eliminates extraneous material. </p>


<p>Today's adult learning environment emphasizes technology, but beyond the rhetoric of customizing education around learners' needs, the concept of Lean Thinking has the potential to improve learning, reduce time wasted, and make adult and online courses truly applicable to real life beyond the virtual school halls.</p>

<p>So let me get this straight:</p>


<p>Noah is supposed to have had dinosaurs on the ark with him? And Jesus 'rode them'? What? This is what they teach the poor kids that are suckered into having the 'Beginners Bible' coloring book?</p>


<p>That doesn't even remotely make sense. even if the 'Noahs Ark' story were true, which it isn't, the dinosaur was wiped out by the end of the Mesozoic era, which is WAY before the Romans and the 3 Kings and all that. So what's up? Besides that, according to their own chronology, the 'flood' was supposed to be about 4500 years ago, which would be roughly 2500 years before Jesus was born - so he went back in time to ride the dinosaurs?</p>


<p>This just goes to explain why all of the Jesus people are confused. The things they are taught just don't add up. It's like they are trying to build little robots that don't EVER ask questions because they know the answers are not really the point.</p>


<p>from wikipedia:<br />
<i><br />
Cognitive dissonance is an uncomfortable feeling caused by holding two contradictory ideas simultaneously. </i></p>


<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance</a></p>


<p>Fact: Dinosaurs lived in the Mesozoic era.</p>


<p>The Dinosaurs and many of the other large prehistoric reptiles existed in the Mesozoic era of the Phanerozoic aeon. The Mesozoic era ran from about 250 million years ago to 65 million years ago.</p>


<p>from <a href="http://www.dinosaur-facts.com/timelines/dinosaur-timeline/" title="http://www.dinosaur-facts.com/timelines/dinosaur-timeline/">http://www.dinosaur-facts.com/timelines/dinosaur-timeline/</a></p>


<p>Fact: According to the Biblical chronology the global flood occurred approximately 4500 years ago.</p>


<p>Also funny: the way <a href="http://www.nwcreation.net/noahsark.html" target="_blank">this dude</a> tries to defend the indefensible. This paragraph is the kicker:<br />
<i><br />
According to the Biblical chronology the global flood occurred approximately 4500 years ago. If this event occurred as described in the Bible, the geological evidence left behind could never be correctly interpreted by a naturalist. Although the earth is covered in monumental volumes of sediment, the existence of modern animals atop these deposits must be explained naturally (i.e. many local floods, gradual deposition over millions of years). However, the Bible specifically says that God caused the earth to be flooded until the waters exceeded the highest mountain by 20 feet (Gen 7:20), and to the extent necessary so no human was capable of surviving without supernatural intervention. The evidence of this event covers the entire world, but can not be correctly interpreted by modern science due to their atheistic philosophy and naturalistic presuppositions.<br />
</i></p>


<p>This is why creationists are generally not sought after for their scientific opinions. :)</p>

			        <p class="teaser_info"><p>Lesbians like sushi and bisexuals like hot dogs and sushi. Lesbians would never be interested in eating hot dogs. A lesbian can eat sushi all day every day and never consider hot dogs. In fact, lesbians can never eat too much sushi. A bisexual can go without sushi, then really miss the feel and taste of sushi, because there is nothing like sushi. Then they go out and get some sushi. They swear they can go without hot dogs, because sushi is so much better. They start to eat sushi all day every day. The lesbian continues to do the same.</p>


<p>Then one day the sushi is a little stale and the bisexual remembers how hot dogs are different. She didn't have that problem with hot dogs, at least not that she can remember. Eating hot dogs was easier and less complicated. The lesbian does not start to crave a hot dog when this happens. The lesbian knows she only likes sushi, so even though it got stale, she is still focused only on the sushi. She wants the sushi to get better, because she knows really great sushi is hard to find. The bisexual won't try as hard to figure out why the sushi got stale. Sooner or later she will do what is easier. She will go out for a hot dog. There are hot dogs on every corner and she knows she'll have a few to choose from soon enough. Perhaps she will just have hot dogs for a long time or will try some hot dog rolls or sushi dogs. This is why I prefer lesbians. The only problem is that they may go out for some completely different sushi, thinking that the new sushi will be different. But at least they are aren't out eating hot dogs.</p>

Date: 2009-07-12, 12:26AM MST</p>


<p>Shall we play a game?</p>


<p>While not exactly the correct topic for this, I have been told that bots often browse these pages as well.</p>


<p>I'm tired of the spammer bots scene with standard_io replies, just trying to score another e-mail address for their database.</p>


<p>Looking for a bot a little more grounded. I'm not expecting you to be a full out Fembot, or the latest Pixar render farm, but you should at least be a stable operating system and not tied down to any network. (I said stable, as in predictable, no random crashes or zombies. No excessive blue screens or personal daemons either please.)</p>


<p>I am a sucker for high end graphics. Up to date virus protection is a must. Please have a job, other than just farming gold in WOW. Passing the Turning Test is a major plus.</p>


<p>A little about me: I am a male bot with gigabytes of drive and a positronic attitude. I may not be the prettiest of interfaces, but I am CD ripped, and I must admit, people often tell me that I could pass for an Autobot. I have been known to interact with a female hacker from time to time. I hope this is within protocol.</p>


<p>I can entertain myself with minesweeper and solitaire, but always up for a nice game of chess. I enjoy Opera, Wine, and cookies. I love to travel and explore via Google Earth, and have brought back many tokens to share.</p>


<p>Thanks for processing my post.</p>

<p>In computability theory, the halting problem is a decision problem which can be stated as follows: given a description of a program and a finite input, decide whether the program finishes running or will run forever, given that input.</p>


<p>Alan Turing proved in 1936 that a general algorithm to solve the halting problem for all possible program-input pairs cannot exist. We say that the halting problem is undecidable over Turing machines.</p>


<p>And p = np : </p>


<p>In essence, the question P = NP? asks: if 'yes'-answers to a 'yes'-or-'no'-question can be verified "quickly" (in polynomial time), can the answers themselves also be computed quickly?</p>

			        <a href="/2009/08/why-yahoo-news-is-just-like-fox">why Yahoo news is just like FOX</a>
			        <p class="teaser_info"><p>Yahoo is quickly becoming the same slobbery propaganda-spewing hate-maw that Fox is. Here's how you know. Of course, this story was 'provided' by the New York Times, which some say is a 'liberal' source - but admittedly, only on 'cosmopolitan' issues like gay marriage, as opposed to 'hard' news like fiscal or domestic policy where most people don't pay attention but the ones that do mostly accuse The Gray Lady of actually being conservative.</p>


<p>Here is the untenable nugget of right-wing silliness:</p>


<p><i><br />
If the president's proposals are all adopted, the figure that year will be 20.7 percent, with increases from 2009 for every group — those with the lowest incomes as well as those with the highest. How can that be, given that the president has promised to raise taxes only on those who make at least $250,000 a year?</i></p>


<p>Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, points to two reasons. First, Mr. Obama does not want to continue some special tax breaks, like a tax credit for new homeowners, that were part of the stimulus package he pushed through Congress. More important, the 2012 estimates assume a better economy, in which incomes will be higher and more people will therefore be in higher tax brackets.</p>


<p>Mr. Williams argues that, eventually, President Obama's vow not to raise taxes on the middle class is going to have to be violated. “There is just not enough money” earned by the very, very rich, Mr. Williams said.<br />
</p>


<p>What?</p>


<p>There is <b>'just not enough money earned by the very, very rich?'</b>.</p>


<p>What planet are you on, Floyd?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.demos.org/inequality/numbers.cfm" title="http://www.demos.org/inequality/numbers.cfm">http://www.demos.org/inequality/numbers.cfm</a></p>


<p>Here's a highlight for you:<br />
<i><br />
The richest one percent of U.S. households now owns 34.3 percent of the nation's private wealth, more than the combined wealth of the bottom 90 percent. The top one percent also owns 36.9 percent of all corporate stock.</i></p>


<p>You don't have to raise taxes on the middle class.</p>


<p>You just don't. The top 10% is all you need.</p>

			        <p class="teaser_info"><p>This is a link to a story Barack posted on the Washington Post last month.</p>


<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/11/AR2009071100647.html" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/11/AR2009071100647.html">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/11/AR200907...</a></p>


<p>I find it sort of fascinating that we have in a few short generations gone from the 'fireside chat' to the on-demand blog post. :)</p>


<p>Although this was already news a few weeks ago I needed to show fairness because my last post was sort of critical of Barack. Just to be clear, Barack is not doing anything that Bill Clinton didn't do in the early 90s, which is to say talk 'left' and move 'center-right'. It's just that I am smarter now, or at least more informed, and if I had been quite a bit more political and maybe a little bit more sober during my early twenties I would have fought NAFTA and the School of the Americas and the tax cuts and the pardons and the financial deregulation that got us here. Anyway, that being said here is breakdown of what the Obama administration is proud of.</p>


<p>The financial crisis - on this one I can't give him a pass. Here is what he says:</p>


<p>The swift and aggressive action we took in those first few months has helped pull our financial system and our economy back from the brink.</p>


<p>This I don't buy for a second. Throwing money at bad debt for your cronies in the banks without demanding they go into receivership is called sweeping the problem under the rug. Obama had a chance to hold their feet to the fire and all he said was 'psyche'.</p>


<p><a href="http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=D96FH8I00&amp;show_article=1" title="http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=D96FH8I00&amp;show_article=1">http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=D96FH8I00&amp;show_article=1</a></p>


<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act - this seems like some decent legislation.</p>

<p>There seems to be money for a lot of domestic programs that need help. Of course there are more tax cuts, some more bank bailout money and some other pork but for the most part this seems like smart spending. Of course the total here is about half a trillion dollars which is still less than the 700 billion in TARP money (linked here - <a href="http://www.prisonplanet.com/the-secret-history-of-tarp-how-goldman-bailed-out-goldman%E2%80%A6.html" title="http://www.prisonplanet.com/the-secret-history-of-tarp-how-goldman-bailed-out-goldman%E2%80%A6.html">http://www.prisonplanet.com/the-secret-history-of-tarp-how-goldman-baile...</a>) that we know about - so the banks get bailed out faster and bigger than the people. But at least there's something.</p>


<p>Health Care - it's hard to give points for taking single-payer off the table, so I won't do it. Read this: <a href="http://www.adn.com/opinion/compass/story/893083.html" title="http://www.adn.com/opinion/compass/story/893083.html">http://www.adn.com/opinion/compass/story/893083.html</a></p>


<p>And finally, we have the new college tax credit. Read here: <a href="http://collegesavings.about.com/b/2009/02/12/the-stimulus-package-and-college-costs-an-update-on-the-american-opportunity-tax-credit.htm" title="http://collegesavings.about.com/b/2009/02/12/the-stimulus-package-and-college-costs-an-update-on-the-american-opportunity-tax-credit.htm">http://collegesavings.about.com/b/2009/02/12/the-stimulus-package-and-co...</a></p>


<p>This seems like a decent implementation of a good idea. I'm not sure how a $2,500 tax credit is going to put your kid through college but it can't hurt.</p>


<p>So that's it - the rest of <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/11/AR2009071100647.html">Obama's</a> post is more or less fluff, where he says things like:</p>


<p>Already, we're making progress on health-care reform that controls costs while ensuring choice and quality, as well as energy legislation that will make clean energy the profitable kind of energy, leading to whole new industries and jobs that cannot be outsourced. </p>


<p>Of course there are no specifics on health care or energy legislation, so I guess we'll have to give him a pass on that for now.</p>


<p>So, as far as I can tell that gives Barack a 2 out of 4. Thanks for playing. I suppose that's better than shrubbie would have done. :)</p>

<p>Did you know, for instance, that they...</p>


<p>...steered hundreds of billions of bail-out dollars to the very people who drove the country into the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, required nothing of these sharks in return, and did almost nothing for ordinary Americans struggling to survive this disaster?</p>


<p>...opposed congressional legislation limiting financial institution incentive pay packages that put the whole global economy at risk?</p>


<p>...opposed legislation allowing shareholders the right to have even a non-binding say on salaries, even though executives took home billions in bonuses last year while their companies were hemorrhaging money so badly they required a trillion bucks in taxpayer bail-out?</p>


<p>...actually threatened Britain, America's closest ally in the world, with withdrawal of intelligence data that could prevent terrorist attacks unless the British government blocked one of its courts from accepting documented evidence of torture at Guantanamo?</p>


<p>...sent droves of Predator-launched missiles into Pakistan - supposedly one of America's allies - killing groups of civilians, even at weddings, thus intensifying hatred toward the United States?</p>


<p>...tried to shut down a charity's illegal-surveillance suit against the government on the basis of a supposed constitutionally-grounded state secrets privilege which would allow the president to kill any legal case before it is even heard?</p>


<p>...undertook a blitz of immigration enforcement without reform of civil rights violations so nasty that one professor of immigration law described the policies as "literally the worst of all worlds"?</p>


<p>...refused to set legally enforceable immigration detention rules covering such basics as health care and legal representation, instead relying on a flawed contractor-based monitoring system?</p>


<p>...pressured a member of Congress to withdraw an amendment that would have ended the military's disastrous "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" regime, simply by defunding it?</p>


<p>...asked a federal court to dismiss a case in which the plaintiffs challenged the discriminatory Defense of Marriage Act, arguing to the court that heterosexual marriage is "the traditional, and universally recognized, version of marriage"?</p>


<p>...dramatically increased the influence of religion in government, directly violating the First Amendment, by lavishly spending federal dollars on "faith-based' programs, and giving religious groups massively increased power and access within the White House to shape policy questions?</p>


<p>...stood by silently, allowing climate legislation to be watered down to nothing, to include generous pollution allowances to coal utilities, and to undermine the EPA's authority to control carbon emissions?</p>


<p>...backed healthcare legislation that did little for the public and actually increased wasteful federal expenditures, while continuing to enrich insurance, medical, hospital and pharmaceutical corporation vampires?</p>

<p>I can't watch television. I try. I want to, occasionally. But I get fidgety. Not in the standard kind of 'Peanuts' way, where voices of 'authority' seem to sound like underwater whale cries but in the I-totally-know-what-you-are-going-to-say-before-you-say-it kind of way. That's what I get from TV now - a fast read on whatever the underlying shill is, and I spend the rest of the time wondering why the hell they are still talking.</p>


<p>You burn more calories SLEEPING than you do watching television. Think about that. I think that's why I have turned to web surfing from channel surfing - it may be just as tedious but at least you really are engaged, and you really are in control - at least compared to having a single choice of local cable service. That's why I love technology - as a blogger, my life of leisure has now fused with my life as a seeker of truth and my life as an artist - through the channels of rss, http and now increasingly Twitter, I can relax, learn and self-express in the same interactive environment.</p>


<p>Can your TV do that?</p>

			        <a href="/2009/07/get-back-to-work">Get back to work</a>
			        <p class="teaser_info"><p>I am home now. I learned a few things in Europe. My wife and I had a truly amazing trip to Paris, Rome, Barcelona, San Sebastian (aka Donostia), Cahors, Annecy and then back to Paris. We tried not to take anything for granted and we truly felt completely blessed to have such a great trip with more or less awesome weather. With the exception of about 2 days in Annecy, the only thing that could be said about the weather is that it was occasionally a little TOO sunny. :)</p>


<p>That being said, I learned a few things.</p>


<p>1 - We should be grateful (here in the US). The rest of my comments will be more less critical of the US when compared to the above-mentioned places, but it deserves to be mentioned first that even in big cities like Paris and Rome you will find yourself waiting around a lot longer (and looking a a lot harder) than you are used to for things like breakfast, last minute booze necessities, an internet connection, or any of the many sundry things that we modern consumers look for obsessively. Now that I am home, I am within 50 steps of late night food, a Starbucks that opens at 5:30am, and a CVS that closes way later than I need it to.</p>


<p>2 - Lunch is the day's gift to you and will be ignored or taken lightly only to your own detriment. Some of my favorite moments were in Paris and Rome and some other places where if you can find a restaurant at the optimum place in its lunch rush (too early often means bad service, so you want to get in around 2pm) you can get in and out pretty quickly and feel sort of nourished by the warm blanket of the local hustle. We always looked for places that were at 80-ish percent with people that are really eating (instead of just drinks) so that you could tell it was busy because the food was good.</p>


<p>3 - As a correlary to two, when possible get the 'menu' or 'formule', which is basically a line-up of daily specials with an added cost savings; failing that at least get a daily special if they are available only by themselves because they are often awesome and very 'a propos' of the local region.</p>


<p>4 - Rock the vino in the carafe. A full bottle is often too much for two people over lunch, but the 'demi' carafe is half a liter and is 2 good glasses each which is all you need. By the time you have had the obligatory espresso (skip the milk because it's expensive and pointless), the wine has worn off and you're feeling pretty good. We had a demi carafe of rose with almost every meal and it was delicious. I also suspect the wines in the carafe are more suitable for lunch because they seem to be a little lower proof (weaker by volume).</p>


<p>5 - It's good to get around. The pure joy of travel is pretty hard to beat, as long as you're ready to roll with the punches a little bit.</p>


<p>6 - Always ask for what you want - nicely. This is more of a life lesson, but it's good to always stay nice because you may actually get what you want (although not always) if you communicate it correctly, and if you get mean you will end up regretting it. It's also better that way for the other person. :)</p>


<p>7 - CNN is crap - really a great big stinking propaganda turd, and although the BBC has it's own smaller problems it is generally informative and far less biased than CNN. Oh media, how far have ye fallen?</p>


<p>8 - Rome is a sweet elixir for really anything. I have heard some criticisms about Rome, most of which I don't agree with. The only negative we found about Rome is that if you don't speak Italian a lot of the merchants/restaurants will try to price gouge you, but as long as they have printed prices you're basically ok and if they don't just be ready to haggle.</p>


<p>So that's it for now, more later.</p>

			        <p class="teaser_info"><p>This is becoming quite the regular feature. On the heels of showing you the ugly face of mindless dogma-driven religious psycho-babble, we have a great example of mindless dogma-driven political psycho-babble. It all started when a friend posted a short message about the "only sure thing in life is change".</p>


<p>My favorite points:</p>


<p>1 - friend1 who is the right winger vitriol machine by post 5 is already trying to calm herself down. :)</p>


<p>2 - although friend1 never actually links to any source, or even mentions one, by post 8 the original poster has already 'hosted' a debate in the past tense. I guess a debate for FOX people is basically one person screaming and it lasts about 30 seconds.</p>


<p>3 - friend1 has pretty bad spelling and grammar, which is such a pattern for right wing hate spewers (see any comment thread, anywhere) that it bears mention. Thanks for being typical!</p>


<p>4 - 'Let's not confuse "complaining" with the facts' is a non-sequitur. You can still complain about facts, and by the same token, you are by no means forced to complain about untruthful propaganda. But that is probably confusing for our friend1 who seems to think these 'facts' that no one can verify entitle her to turn a little status update into a political dog fight.</p>


<p>5 - Notice how people on the right are always the first to lower the bar. Ok, so I started with a question: "why are you complaining?", which to me is an invitation to discourse, although possibly tainted with a little antagonism. But that's a far cry from 'quit believing what the left-winged media spoons [sic] feeds you and start using the brain that God gave you', which to me is more than a little insulting, pre-supposes a Christian heritage, and is of course a directive (a diplomatic no-no).</p>


<p>6 - friend1 has no more to say at all, if she actually responds I will post again.</p>


<p>7 - Finally, to my mind the real tragedy is that we have plenty of things to be angry at Obama about, and this is not one of them. Just another case of some Texas girl (friend1 is from the Bush state) parroting right-wing propaganda because she likes to be a bitch, <i>just a little bit</i>, with no respect for the Academic tradition of actually 'sourcing' your data. Sheesh.</p>


<p>Anyway, without further ado, here it is:</p>


<hr />


<p>status update by (<b>OP</b>): .......The only sure thing in life is change......</p>


<p><b>friend1</b>: ...and death and taxes. When Obama is done with us we will even be taxed for dying. Good times...</p>


<p><b>me</b>: <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/28418678/the_death_tax_scam" title="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/28418678/the_death_tax_scam">http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/28418678/the_death_tax_scam</a></p>


<p>Estates worth up to $7 million per couple, and $3.5 million for individuals, are already exempt from taxes — meaning that 99.75 percent of all Americans die without paying a dime to Uncle Sam.</p>


<p>Are you really worth over $7 million?...</p>


<p>If not, why are you complaining?<br />
If so, why are you complaining?</p>


<p><b>friend2</b>: um, i do believe bush pretty much took care of that.</p>


<p><b>friend1</b>: Ah, yes. What RS and the other liberal media venues fail to mention is that under your president's plan, by 2011, the exemption will be back down to $1,000,000 at a 55% rate. What this means is that when our loved ones die and pass on money, property, businesses, etc., we will have a short time to come up with the tax. If the capital is not readily available, we must start selling off assets to cover said tax. Look at the economy now. The value of land and improvements has severly declined, even though tax records may have the property valued at a much greater rate per previous years. Have you ever heard of "house poor"? This could potentially be far more severe to you and me, meaning we could lose our own personal property in the deal. Uncle Sam waits for no man.<br />
Your boy Obama and his pals Reed and Palosi have an agenda. Quit believing what the left-winged media spoons feeds you and start using the brain that God gave you.<br />
Let's not confuse "complaining" with the facts.</p>


<p><b>friend1</b>:  Oh, and <name>, you said bush...</name></p>


<p>Here's an idea...Let's all do some yoga and CHILL!</p>


<p><b>OP</b>: Exactly!! You have 4 years before you can change that choice!</p>


<p><b>friend2</b>: LOL I just got it <op>. <friend1>, not much up to snuff here on the economic aspects, although I am trying to learn. But I can assure you that even with my current disappointment with this admin I can safely say it is FAR better than what the alternative being offered. Not going to get into it here but if you want, we can have a drink sometime...would loveto hear differing POV's. Academic debate if you will. Love ya...Peace out</friend1></op></p>


<p><b>OP</b>: Death &amp; Taxes were far from my mind.......I was just thinking about your everyday no big deal or maybe some big changes..........</p>


<p><b>friend2</b>: lol. see what a simple thought can produce...you instigator..</p>


<p><b>friend1</b>: I am always up for cocktails and friendly banter. What are you doing these days? <b>OP</b>, thanks for hosting the debate! ; ))</p>


<p><b>friend2</b>: yes <b>OP</b>, thanks for hosting. I have most nights free. just let me know.</p>


<p><b>friend3</b>: funny stuff above. I think <b>friend1</b> needs some yoga!</p>


<p><b>me</b>: Got any 'sources' on that?</p>

<p>There are some real doozies in here - everything below this line was not written by me.</p>


<hr />


<p><i><br />
Your Status: A question for my religious friends(all of you, pretty much); Isn't "faith" just a word for "I believe it because I want to"?<br />
</i><br />
My Response: </p>


<p>interesting question... I enjoy this type of question when it is sincerely asked because it isn't one I thought of and sometimes the non-religious see things through shades of a different tint then I do... and therefore ask questions that leave me thinking: how do I explain it? </p>


<p>I wouldn't say that belief is only "because I want to" because, at least for me, belief includes a lot of things I wouldn't mind not believing in so it isn't a matter of want. I don't want to believe that hell or the devil exists but I do... there is good stuff I believe too... but with it there is some not so fun stuff. And being Catholic there are sure a lot of sins to avoid (like dodging land mines)</p>


<p>I think the best way to explain it (and it doesn't really explain it at all) is: For those who believe no explanation is necessary and for those who do not no explanation will ever be enough. I believe because I sense a lot of magic in the world and feel that nature/science is so intricate that there is a design... anyway sorry that this was so long... but you asked ;) a good movie to rent (but it could be a snore fest because it is black and white and there aren't any car chases or explosives) is: The Song of Bernadette - it won an Academy Award for best picture the year it was out so I think even the non-religious enjoyed this movie - but it is very Catholic. that is where I got that quote I mentioned earlier from. I bet Lisa would like it if she hasn't seen it already. :)</p>


<p>>>> Your Response to that:</p>


<p>I agree, there is probably intelligent design of some kind. Any objective view of life makes it hard to believe otherwise. But why Christ over Vishnu, or Allah over Yahweh? Why the need to stack magic and antiquated dogma on to it? To say it more simply: Isn't the miracle of birth magical enough? Do we need virgin birth? Especially given the amount of other Iron Age mythology that includes things like saviors being born from virgins or great floods ect. The closer I look at organized religion the more obvious it becomes that it is a construct of humans, not gods. But, again, what is so obvious to me is not to the great majority of people and I'm not so arrogant as to think them all stupid so I don't know. I don't know anything for sure, but I just find the idea of a "personal god" , watching over everyone improbable to say the least.</p>


<p>>>> My Response:</p>


<p>Okay... these are broad questions you ask so I'm trying to think of a way to be concise and thoughtful which I already know cannot pull that off so I apologize in advance. Also I'm speaking for myself here (I'm not an authority of the Catholic church, but I am going to speak as a Catholic... take what I say with a grain of salt). </p>


<p>To answer your questions:</p>


<p><i>Your Question: Why Chirst over Vishnu, or Allah over Yahweh? </i></p>


<p>For me: I think we all start with what we know and that is what I did. I was born Catholic and hated going to stuff as a kid but then in high school there were some dynamic speakers who got my attention: which was great because that is around the time I really started to have questions (like this one). So it started for me with my mother (forcing me to go to church) and it started with what my culture is. However then learning the history of the world and of the church kept me going. From Judeaism to Christianity and the liniage [sic] of popes and stories of the saints... all of that made me feel like the Catholic Church wasn't found [sic] just yesterday and there is a lot to back it up... most questions that came to my head there was an explanation. There is a trail that goes back to the start and then to today. Does it all make perfect sense: NO! But it is there.</p>


<p>Organized Religion is a disapline [sic]. Like playing music or a sport: if you really care about it then you are involved and practice. If I believe that there is a design to the world then I believe there is a designer... and if I believe there is a designer then that sure keeps me curious about this designer. And if I feel every joy I have ever experienced and any joy I will experience in the future is at the hands of this designer then I want to express my gratitude and how thankful I am. Not just that but how can I help but love someone who loves me enough to do this for me?</p>


<p><i>Your Question: Isn't the miracle of birth magical enough? Do we need virgin birth?</i></p>


<p>For me: Knowing that there is a God is supernatural and that is all the magic in the world. Why should out-of-the-ordinary-magic (i.e.: virgin birth, and/or miracles that don't happen daily) be surprising when there is every-day-magic (i.e.: miracles that happen every day: child birth, flowers growing, power of nature...) when "The Designer" has the ability to create anything at all. For a person of faith the virgin birth is then a non-sequitur as far as being extra magical. So why then even have a virgin birth, you are probably wondering??? --- because of the nature of God. As a Catholic I believe that Mary gave birth to God. Also as a Catholic I believe that Jesus is both totally human (flawed with the limits of humanity and subject to temptations) and totally divine (perfection and without any error and without any sin). I believe in paradoxes. Believing in magic paradoxes are [sic] not a stretch for my imagination. Another answer to "why virgin birth?" is that we get used to the daily miracles. We lack the wonder we had as children Scripture says we need to be as a child to enter Heaven (Mark 10:14-15). Sometimes, at least I believe, God gives us out of the ordinary miracles to wake us up. OR to tell us: pay attention to this: this is important! So that to me is why there is the virgin birth.</p>


<p><i>Your statement: Especially given the amount of other Iron Age mythology that includes things like saviors being born from virgins or great floods ect. The closer I look at organized religion the more obvious it becomes that it is a construct of humans, not gods. </i></p>


<p>I found it interesting that you mention the amount of mythology that have flood stories... especially how you see it as evidence that religion is man-made. I feel the total opposite. I find it fascinating that different religions and bodies of people have similar stories in their beliefs even though they are from different parts of the world. I have a hard time believing that is coincidense [sic]. The fact that the details around these events are so different: to me: that is what is human. But that there was a flood? I think that was God. I also find it fascinating that the Greek god Zeus is often depicted with thunderbolts and the Jewish God of the Torah was often depicted as a cloud throwing thunder down. Zeus phenetically [sic] is close to Jesus as well... then there is the Norse god: Thor... also somewhat similar with the thunder. Anyway, I don't believe in the [sic] these mythologies (fun to read up on though) however I do feel there are some underlying truthes [sic] in all these old religions and I find the fact that the stories of such different cultures are so similar to be more of a confirmation of a god then to disprove that it is all made up by people. </p>


<p><i>Your Statement: I just find the idea of a "personal god" , watching over everyone improbable to say the least. </i></p>


<p>Non-religious folks tend knock organized religion... however I have experienced for myself great joy and small miracles because I'm a semi-religious person. The community and friendship and love make me feel this is the right place for me to be and it has been incredibly personal. Now, of course, every thing that I feel is God working in my life could possibly be explained by science or something else (which takes me back to the quote I mentioned earlier: "for those who believe no explanation is necessary, and for those who do not believe no explanation is enough") However I feel that it IS God working. One of the largest examples I have is that I have been in two major car accidents, both where the car was completely totaled, and I not only didn't have any broken bones, I also didn't have a scratch on me. Strictly statistically and scientifically speaking: I should not be alive today or for the last 5 (or more) years. But here I am, relatively healthy. Now - I have had miserable things happen to me too. And tragedies happen to wonderful people every day. I don't have an answer for that (if there is anything that I struggle with in my faith then it is the suffering in the world). I don't know why that happens, but I don't believe it is a lack of a personal God. As a Catholic I believe in many saints who were martyers [sic] and I believe in Jesus who died on a cross... and the the only consolation I can find to that... is that the story isn't over at death. :)</p>

<p><i>The low temperature of ignition and the presence of iron oxide grains less than 120 nm show that the material is not conventional  thermite (which ignites at temperatures above 900 °C) but very likely a form of super-thermite.</i> quoted from:</p>

<p>It is commonly known that the fires in the towers never burned hot enough or long enough to melt the steel frames within them, much less 'pulverize' the steel and allow the towers to fall at a speed within 10% of a 'free-fall'. The simplest explanation, which also fits very well with what the public saw in the news videos, is that the towers were brought down by demolition. This fits with numerous testimonies to the effect of hearing either 'numerous explosions' or 'a crackling sound' just prior the fall.</p>


<p>Now, finally, a study of dust from the site has shown the undeniable and significant presence of 'super-thermite' in all of the samples taken. So, the movement for 911 Truth can now also say that it has stronger data to support the 'controlled demolition' theory than there is to support the 'magically hot and infinitely burning jet fuel' theory. You know, seeing as we had all that evidence just sitting right there, one wonders why Rudy Giuliani recycled the 'crime-scene' steel immediately.</p>

<p>also worthy of note:</p>


<p><strong><br />
The Martha Mitchell Effect</strong></p>


<p>The Martha Mitchell effect is a process by which a belief is mistakenly diagnosed as a delusion by a psychiatrist. This is named after Martha Beall Mitchell (the wife of John Mitchell, the Attorney-General in the Nixon administration) who alleged that illegal activity was taking place in the White House. At the time her claims were thought to be signs of mental illness, and only after the Watergate scandal broke was she proved right (and hence sane).</p>

<p>God is rightly filled with remorse for having killed his creatures. He makes a deal with the animals, promising never to drown them all again. He even puts the rainbow in the sky so that whenever he sees it, it will remind him of his promise so that he won't be tempted to do it again. (Every time God sees the rainbow he says to himself: "Oh, yeah.... That's right. I promised not to drown the animals again. I guess I'll have to find something else to do.")</p>

<p>The mind of God is a terrifying thing - warmonger indeed.</p>


<p>or this:</p>


<p>Lot and his daughters camp out in a cave for a while. The daughters get their "just and righteous" father drunk, and have sexual intercourse with him, and each conceives and bears a son (wouldn't you know it!). Just another wholesome family values Bible story. </p>

<p>So don't drink Coke Zero, or anything else with aspartame - that is, not unless you love formaldehyde buildup at the cellular level. Which you never get rid of.<br />
<i><br />
It is concluded that aspartame consumption may constitute a hazard because of its contribution to the formation of formaldehyde adducts... The fact that it accumulates with each dose, indicates grave consequences among those who consume diet drinks and foodstuffs on a daily basis.<br />

<p>The kicker? Our Buddy Donny 'There Are Unknown Unknowns' 'The Duck' Rumsfeld was prez of SEARLE from 1977 through the approval of aspartame. He's such a go-getter! He ignored all of the brain tumor studies, just to get it approved. We should all be very grateful. They were about to be run into the ground, and he swept in there with his politicos and cleaned it all up. More brain tumors for everyone, and mo money for Donny!</p>

<p>The timeline:</p>


<p>March 24, 1976-- Turner and Olney's petition triggers an FDA investigation of the laboratory practices of aspartame's manufacturer, G.D. Searle. The investigation finds Searle's testing procedures shoddy, full of inaccuracies and "manipulated" test data. The investigators report they "had never seen anything as bad as Searle's testing."</p>


<p>January 10, 1977-- The FDA formally requests the U.S. Attorney's office to begin grand jury proceedings to investigate whether indictments should be filed against Searle for knowingly misrepresenting findings and "concealing material facts and making false statements" in aspartame safety tests. This is the first time in the FDA's history that they request a criminal investigation of a manufacturer.</p>


<p>January 26, 1977-- While the grand jury probe is underway, Sidley &amp; Austin, the law firm representing Searle, begins job negotiations with the U.S. Attorney in charge of the investigation, Samuel Skinner.</p>


<p>March 8, 1977-- G. D. Searle hires prominent Washington insider Donald Rumsfeld as the new CEO to try to turn the beleaguered company around. A former Member of Congress and Secretary of Defense in the Ford Administration, Rumsfeld brings in several of his Washington cronies as top management.</p>


<p>July 1, 1977-- Samuel Skinner leaves the U.S. Attorney's office and takes a job with Searle's law firm. (see Jan. 26th)</p>


<p>August 1, 1977-- The Bressler Report, compiled by FDA investigators and headed by Jerome Bressler, is released. The report finds that 98 of the 196 animals died during one of Searle's studies and weren't autopsied until later dates, in some cases over one year after death. Many other errors and inconsistencies are noted. For example, a rat was reported alive, then dead, then alive, then dead again; a mass, a uterine polyp, and ovarian neoplasms were found in animals but not reported or diagnosed in Searle's reports.</p>


<p>December 8, 1977-- U.S. Attorney Skinner's withdrawal and resignation stalls the Searle grand jury investigation for so long that the statue of limitations on the aspartame charges runs out. The grand jury investigation is dropped.</p>


<p>June 1, 1979-- The FDA established a Public Board of Inquiry (PBOI) to rule on safety issues surrounding NutraSweet.</p>


<p>September 30, 1980-- The Public Board of Inquiry concludes NutraSweet should not be approved pending further investigations of brain tumors in animals. The board states it "has not been presented with proof of reasonable certainty that aspartame is safe for use as a food additive."</p>


<p>January 1981-- Donald Rumsfeld, CEO of Searle, states in a sales meeting that he is going to make a big push to get aspartame approved within the year. Rumsfeld says he will use his political pull in Washington, rather than scientific means, to make sure it gets approved. </p>


<p>And the rest is (tragic) history.</p>

			        <p class="teaser_info"><p>Two friends who shall remain nameless had this exchange on Facebook today, and I find it to be priceless.</p>


<p>Here was the question:<br />
<i><br />
A question for my religious friends(all of you, pretty much); Isn't "faith" just a word for "I believe it because I want to"?</i></p>


<p><b>ANSWER:</b></p>


<p>I wouldn't say that belief is only "because I want to" because, at least for me, belief includes a lot of things I wouldn't mind not believing in so it isn't a matter of want. I don't want to believe that hell or the devil exists but I do... there is good stuff I believe too... but with it there is some not so fun stuff. And being Catholic there are sure a lot of sins to avoid (like dodging land mines)</p>


<p>I think the best way to explain it (and it doesn't really explain it at all) is: For those who believe no explanation is necessary and for those who do not no explanation will ever be enough. I believe because I sense a lot of magic in the world and feel that nature/science is so intricate that there is a design... anyway sorry that this was so long... but you asked ;)</p>


<p>...</p>


<p>How's that for articulate! Woohoo, case for faith made. Slam-dunk, baby.</p>


<p>point 1: 'faith' encompasses 'bad' things too, so it can't be 'just because you want to'; i.e., it's such a bitter pill to swallow, it must be a good thing.</p>


<p>point 2: The true 'case' for faith is irrational.</p>


<p>point 3: This darn world is so complicated, it must be holy - i.e., I don't understand science, so there must be a god.</p>


<p>Thanks for playing!</p>


<p>Come back next week, when we make the case for eating one's own poop.</p>


<p>...</p>


<p>p.s. I am a spiritual person and do believe in a sort of 'god', but the idea that is central to Christianity that goes something like 'there is only one true god' is what bothers me. it is this exclusionary principle that allows anti-choicers to shoot 'baby-killers' and a largely Christian US military to shoot up 'all them heretics' without compunction. This is a deeply destructive concept and has no place in the modern world. I see this apparent here in the idea that 'hell and the devil' are real, and this is seen as an 'objective truth' in the eyes of the respondent. This is dangerous because it necessarily divides her from and antagonizes her against other people in the world that decide not to believe in 'hell and the devil'.</p>


<p>Ah, the lazy mind:<br />
<i><br />
The lazy mind will not take the trouble of going to the bottom of anything; but discouraged by the first difficulties, (and every thing worth knowing is attended with some,) stops short, contents itself with easy, and consequently superficial knowledge, and prefers a great degree of ignorance to a small degree of trouble.<br />

<div align="justify" style="text-align:justify">
<h4>LORD CHESTERFIELD'S LETTERS TO HIS SON</h4>
<p>When Lord Mahon edited the letters of Lord Chesterfield he thought it necessary to warn the intending reader that they are “by no means fitted for early or indiscriminate perusal”. Only “those people whose understandings are fixed and whose principles are matured” can, so his Lordship said, read them with impunity. But that was in 1845. And 1845 looks a little distant now. It seems to us now the age of enormous houses without any bathrooms. Men smoke in the kitchen after the cook has gone to bed. Albums lie upon drawing-room tables. The curtains are very thick and the women are very pure. But the eighteenth century also has undergone a change. To us in 1930 it looks less strange, less remote than those early Victorian years. Its civilisation seems more rational and more complete than the civilisation of Lord Mahon and his contemporaries. Then at any rate a small group of highly educated people lived up to their ideals. If the world was smaller it was also more compact; it knew its own mind; it had its own standards. Its poetry is affected by the same security. When we read the Rape of the Lock we seem to find ourselves in an age so settled and so circumscribed that masterpieces were possible. Then, we say to ourselves, a poet could address himself whole-heartedly to his task and keep his mind upon it, so that the little boxes on a lady's dressing-table are fixed among the solid possessions of our imaginations. A game at cards or a summer's boating party upon the Thames has power to suggest the same beauty and the same sense of things vanishing that we receive from poems aimed directly at our deepest emotions. And just as the poet could spend all his powers upon a pair of scissors and a lock of hair, so too, secure in his world and its values, the aristocrat could lay down precise laws for the education of his son. In that world also there was a certainty, a security that we are now without. What with one thing and another times have changed. We can now read Lord Chesterfield's letters without blushing, or, if we do blush, we blush in the twentieth century at passages that caused Lord Mahon no discomfort whatever.</p>
<p>When the letters begin, Philip Stanhope, Lord Chesterfield's natural son by a Dutch governess, was a little boy of seven. And if we are to make any complaint against the father's moral teaching, it is that the standard is too high for such tender years. “Let us return to oratory, or the art of speaking well; which should never be entirely out of our thoughts”, he writes to the boy of seven. “A man can make no figure without it in Parliament, or the Church, or in the law”, he continues, as if the little boy were already considering his career. It seems, indeed, that the father's fault, if fault it be, is one common to distinguished men who have not themselves succeeded as they should have done and are determined to give their children—and Philip was an only child—the chances that they have lacked. Indeed, as the letters go on one may suppose that Lord Chesterfield wrote as much to amuse himself by turning over the stores of his experience, his reading, his knowledge of the world, as to instruct his son. The letters show an eagerness, an animation, which prove that to write to Philip was not a task, but a delight. Tired, perhaps, with the duties of office and disillusioned with its disappointments, he takes up his pen and, in the relief of free communication at last, forgets that his correspondent is, after all, only a schoolboy who cannot understand half the things that his father says to him. But, even so, there is nothing to repel us in Lord Chesterfield's preliminary sketch of the unknown world. He is all on the side of moderation, toleration, ratiocination. Never abuse whole bodies of people, he counsels; frequent all churches, laugh at none; inform yourself about all things. Devote your mornings to study, your evenings to good society. Dress as the best people dress, behave as they behave, never be eccentric, egotistical, or absent-minded. Observe the laws of proportion, and live every moment to the full.</p>
<p>So, step by step, he builds up the figure of the perfect man—the man that Philip may become, he is persuaded, if he will only—and here Lord Chesterfield lets fall the words which are to colour his teaching through and through—cultivate the Graces. These ladies are, at first, kept discreetly in the background. It is well that the boy should be indulged in fine sentiments about women and poets to begin with. Lord Chesterfield adjures him to respect them both. “For my own part, I used to think myself in company as much above me when I was with Mr. Addison and Mr. Pope, as if I had been with all the Princes in Europe”, he writes. But as time goes on the Virtues are more and more taken for granted. They can be left to take care of themselves. But the Graces assume tremendous proportions. The Graces dominate the life of man in this world. Their service cannot for an instant be neglected. And the service is certainly exacting. For consider what it implies, this art of pleasing. To begin with, one must know how to come into a room and then how to go out again. As human arms and legs are notoriously perverse, this by itself is a matter needing considerable dexterity. Then one must be dressed so that one's clothes seem perfectly fashionable without being new or striking; one's teeth must be perfect; one's wig beyond reproach; one's finger-nails cut in the segment of a circle; one must be able to carve, able to dance, and, what is almost as great an art, able to sit gracefully in a chair. These things are the alphabet of the art of pleasing. We now come to speech. It is necessary to speak at least three languages to perfection. But before we open our lips we must take a further precaution—we must be on our guard never to laugh. Lord Chesterfield himself never laughed. He always smiled. When at length the young man is pronounced capable of speech he must avoid all proverbs and vulgar expressions; he must enunciate clearly and use perfect grammar; he must not argue; he must not tell stories; he must not talk about himself. Then, at last, the young man may begin to practise the finest of the arts of pleasing—the art of flattery. For every man and every woman has some prevailing vanity. Watch, wait, pry, seek out their weakness, “and you will then know what to bait your hook with to catch them”. For that is the secret of success in the world.</p>
<p>It is at this point, such is the idiosyncrasy of our age, that we begin to feel uneasy. Lord Chesterfield's views upon success are far more questionable than his views upon love. For what is to be the prize of this endless effort and self-abnegation? What do we gain when we have learnt to come into rooms and to go out again; to pry into people's secrets; to hold our tongues and to flatter, to forsake the society of low-born people which corrupts and the society of clever people which perverts? What is the prize which is to reward us? It is simply that we shall rise in the world. Press for a further definition, and it amounts perhaps to this: one will be popular with the best people. But if we are so exacting as to demand who the best people are we become involved in a labyrinth from which there is no returning. Nothing exists in itself. What is good society? It is the society that the best people believe to be good. What is wit? It is what the best people think to be witty. All value depends upon somebody else's opinion. For it is the essence of this philosophy that things have no independent existence, but live only in the eyes of other people. It is a looking-glass world, this, to which we climb so slowly; and its prizes are all reflections. That may account for our baffled feeling as we shuffle, and shuffle vainly, among these urbane pages for something hard to lay our hands upon. Hardness is the last thing we shall find. But, granted the deficiency, how much that is ignored by sterner moralists is here seized upon, and who shall deny, at least while Lord Chesterfield's enchantment is upon him, that these imponderable qualities have their value and these shining Graces have their radiance? Consider for a moment what the Graces have done for their devoted servant, the Earl.</p>
<p>Here is a disillusioned politician, who is prematurely aged, who has lost his office, who is losing his teeth, who, worst fate of all, is growing deafer day by day. Yet he never allows a groan to escape him. He is never dull; he is never boring; he is never slovenly. His mind is as well groomed as his body. Never for a second does he “welter in an easy-chair”. Private though these letters are, and apparently spontaneous, they play with such ease in and about the single subject which absorbs them that it never becomes tedious or, what is still more remarkable, never becomes ridiculous. It may be that the art of pleasing has some connection with the art of writing. To be polite, considerate, controlled, to sink one's egotism, to conceal rather than to obtrude one's personality, may profit the writer even as they profit the man of fashion.</p>
<p>Certainly there is much to be said in favour of the training, however we define it, which helped Lord Chesterfield to write his Characters. The little papers have the precision and formality of some old-fashioned minuet. Yet the symmetry is so natural to the artist that he can break it where he likes; it never becomes pinched and formal, as it would in the hands of an imitator. He can be sly; he can be witty; he can be sententious, but never for an instant does he lose his sense of time, and when the tune is over he calls a halt. “Some succeeded, and others burst” he says of George the First's mistresses: the King liked them fat. Again, “He was fixed in the house of lords, that hospital of incurables.” He smiles: he does not laugh. Here the eighteenth century, of course, came to his help. Lord Chesterfield, though he was polite to everything, even to the stars and Bishop Berkeley's philosophy, firmly refused, as became a son of his age, to dally with infinity or to suppose that things are not quite as solid as they seem. The world was good enough and the world was big enough as it was. This prosaic temper, while it keeps him within the bounds of impeccable common sense, limits his outlook. No single phrase of his reverberates or penetrates as so many of La Bruyère's do. But he would have been the first to deprecate any comparison with that great writer; besides, to write as La Bruyère wrote, one must perhaps believe in something, and then how difficult to observe the Graces! One might perhaps laugh; one might perhaps cry. Both are equally deplorable.</p>
<p>But while we amuse ourselves with this brilliant nobleman and his views on life we are aware, and the letters owe much of their fascination to this consciousness, of a dumb yet substantial figure on the farther side of the page. Philip Stanhope is always there. It is true that he says nothing, but we feel his presence in Dresden, in Berlin, in Paris, opening the letters and poring over them and looking dolefully at the thick packets which have been accumulating year after year since he was a child of seven. He had grown into a rather serious, rather stout, rather short young man. He had a taste for foreign politics. A little serious reading was rather to his liking. And by every post the letters came—urbane, polished, brilliant, imploring and commanding him to learn to dance, to learn to carve, to consider the management of his legs, and to seduce a lady of fashion. He did his best. He worked very hard in the school of the Graces, but their service was too exacting. He sat down half-way up the steep stairs which lead to the glittering hall with all the mirrors. He could not do it. He failed in the House of Commons; he subsided into some small post in Ratisbon; he died untimely. He left it to his widow to break the news which he had lacked the heart or the courage to tell his father—that he had been married all these years to a lady of low birth, who had borne him children.</p>
<p>The Earl took the blow like a gentleman. His letter to his daughter-inlaw is a model of urbanity. He began the education of his grandsons. But he seems to have become a little indifferent to what happened to himself after that. He did not care greatly if he lived or died. But still to the very end he cared for the Graces. His last words were a tribute of respect to those goddesses. Someone came into the room when he was dying; he roused himself: “Give Dayrolles a chair,” he said, and said no more.</p>

<p>Anyway, the reason I'm talking about American Idol is simple - it is because yesterday, one of top the top 10 trending 'twopics' on Twitter was '#SaveEarl', which came about because whichever network (NBC?) carries My Name is Earl decided to drop it, and noooo, the Twitterverse can't have that. So we had thousands of voices yesterday waxing victimized about it; it was quite a sight. Whereupon, I decided to write </p>


<p>#saveearl screw Earl save Aung San <a href="http://www.burmacampaign.org.uk/mtvaction.html" title="http://www.burmacampaign.org.uk/mtvaction.html">http://www.burmacampaign.org.uk/mtvaction.html</a> #burma #SuuKyi</p>


<p>and I didn't get a lot of love.</p>


<p>My point was that if this much otherwise unused energy can be harnessed so easily to 'Save Earl', as they say, maybe someone somewhere can appreciate the devilish irony that this kind of activity is always necessarily irrelevant. If it were to involve something meaningful like putting real political pressure on our own government to weigh in more heavily on the Aung San Suu Kyi issue, then 99% of our sedated community would gloss over and start looking for America Idol - which itself is not news.</p>


<p>I think the story of our generation is now beginning to be "How the hell can we break our addiction to oil?", and that is a good thing. I think it should also be "How the hell can we break our addiction to television?", because I guarantee they go hand in hand. I will even go one further - we've heard a lot of talk about this lack of morality on Wall street; we as taxpayers were deliberately sodomized repeatedly, after which we were told that it was for our own good. This pattern continues.</p>


<p>I've also heard that daydreaming actually allows the subconscious brain to resolve inner issues of morality and deep emotional connection building, relative to the recent past, as if when left alone the subconscious starts making sense out of disparate 'stuff' from that day.</p>


<p>We also know that brain activity levels are at their lowest when someone is watching TV; the subconscious is not free at that point to do anything, it is functionally shackled.</p>


<p>So my final point is this - we will not fix Wall Street, nor will we harness the populist power of the middle and working classes, until everyone gets rid of their television and starts daydreaming.</p>


<p>A lot.</p>


<p>There's flies in the kitchen<br />
I can hear them a-buzzin'<br />
and I ain't done nothing<br />
since I woke up today<br />
how can a person<br />
go to work in the morning<br />
come home in the evening<br />
and have nothing to say?</p>

<p>So far, I have noticed:<br />
MusicMonday, as in -<br />
#musicmonday this song rocks! </p>


<p>and FollowFriday, as in -<br />
#followfriday @myfriend has the mad links, yo!</p>


<p>It reminds me a bit of what would happen if we were all still in kindergarten, which then reminds me of those NYU kids who held up their own cafeteria last Fall - you know, what happens when no one is in charge, except everyone is. Which means trending topics (twopics) are subject to the lemming law, which is to say that in an echo chamber you can't count votes and think they are unique.</p>


<p>The lemming law meaning: in the Twitterverse, anyone and everyone is happy to follow anyone else off a cliff. The cliff of deliberate propaganda, or the cliff of general collective foolishness, or the cliff of faux outrage.</p>


<p>So what's next? troubledtuesday, where everyone vents their woes...<br />
#troubledtuesday ah, the angst of it all!</p>


<p>or even Wacky Wednesday?<br />
#wackywed I'm too sexy for my keyboard...</p>

			        <p class="teaser_info"><p>Having once participated in a week-long workshop comprising both philosophers and computer scientists, one difference in disciplinary style quickly became evident: Faced with a description of a new application domain or problem, a typical computer scientist immediately thinks:</p>


<p>    How can I simplify this problem or abstract away from some of the details of its description, in order to make progress towards solving it?</p>


<p>    while a typical philosopher immediately thinks:</p>


<p>    What implicit assumptions have been made or distinctions overlooked in this problem description, which need to be articulated, analyzed and discussed before we start to tackle it?</p>


<p>   Needless to say, these different disciplinary styles themselves became the subject of discussion by some of the philosophers present, much to the annoyance of the computer scientists!</p>

			        <p class="teaser_info"><p>quote from the article:</p>


<p>It's the same thing with this torture business. There are a lot of people in this country who genuinely believe that torture opponents are “not upset” about things like 9/11 or the beheading of American hostages. The idea that “no one complains when Americans are murdered” is crazy — of course we “complained,” and of course we'd all like to round up those machete-wielding monsters and shoot them into space — but these people really believe this, they really believe that torture opponents are secretly unimpressed/untroubled by Islamic terrorism, at least as compared to American “enhanced interrogation.” For them to believe that, they must really believe that such people are traitors, nursing a secret agenda (an agenda perhaps unknown even to themselves, their America-hatred being ingrained so deep) against their own country. Which is really an amazing thing for large numbers of Americans to believe about another large group of Americans, when you think about it.<br />
&lt;!--break--><br />
and the comment by 'kaote':</p>


<p>You're absolutely right, they do "believe" thinking, genuinely principled Americans are traitors. It's also interesting to note that these torture zealots are also the people that obsess the most about so-called "values" which seem to be arbitrarily selected from the most irrelevant, none-of-your-business aspects of morality they can find (most of them sexual, which says something about these people as well).</p>


<p>The scarequotes around believe, though, are necessary, because we Americans who are capable of thought have a different notion of what that word actually entails. When we believe something, it's the direct result of having gathered the facts, applied logic and reason to them, and come to a defensible conclusion. Their beliefs are entirely different animals that, as you note, seem to bubble up from their unconscious and then grasp wildly for some sort of explanation that pitifully mocks logic, which makes you wonder which came first, religion or the swarms of retarded non-thinkers.</p>


<p>The paranoia and fear-based conspiratorialism they apply to everything political (and often refer to as "The Culture Wars") appeals to their macho, us vs. them gut response, and the gut is where we should do all of our thinking, just ask Glenn Beck. They're so used to "thinking" this way and being agreed with by their backwater compatriots that they've never really considered that they could be wrong, hence their rage when some intellectual asshole comes along and effortlessly dismisses them with high-falutin' rational thinking.</p>


<p>This is how we get stuck in "debates" about non-issues that often break out along geographical lines, with the least educated, most gut-checking types almost always to the right of the issue. We, the thinking, let them push us into debates about things that are so obvious you wouldn't think we needed to discuss them at all, like the fact that creationism has nothing to do with science. These are factual matters, and even though we're talking about morality in this case, you would think that just pushing them to be consistent would be enough to reach agreement. They don't even realize that they're undermining their own notion of morality, which is usually seen to be deontological, not consequentialist like Krauthammer's. You can't believe people to be inherently evil while also holding the belief that your actions can be defended based on the results. I know, I know, way beyond anything they want to consider...</p>


<p>But they're not really interested in being logical or consistent. Quite frankly, they don't know how to be. They're interested in being "right", whether by force of argument or repetition.</p>


<p>I should add (and I'm quite sure the reader is aware) that the "liberals" do this shit, too. There, fair and balanced.</p>

			        <p class="teaser_info"><p>Where did this idea come from that NPR is "liberal"? Are we talking Phil Ochs's definition, "five degrees left of center mostly, but ten degrees right of center when it affects them personally"? I hope so, because that's the only sense of "liberal" I can see applying to NPR. During eight years of the worst presidency in history, they bent so far over backwards to be "fair" to the Bushies that they were usually left chewing on their own pubic hair.</p>

<p>Phil Ochs lyrics for reference:</p>


<p>I cried when they shot Medgar Evers<br />
Tears ran down my spine<br />
I cried when they shot Mr. Kennedy<br />
As though I'd lost a father of mine<br />
But Malcolm X got what was coming<br />
He got what he asked for this time<br />
So love me, love me, love me, I'm a liberal</p>


<p>I go to civil rights rallies<br />
And I put down the old D.A.R.<br />
I love Harry and Sidney and Sammy<br />
I hope every colored boy becomes a star<br />
But don't talk about revolution<br />
That's going a little bit too far<br />
So love me, love me, love me, I'm a liberal</p>


<p>I cheered when Humphrey was chosen<br />
My faith in the system restored<br />
I'm glad the commies were thrown out<br />
of the A.F.L. C.I.O. board<br />
I love Puerto Ricans and Negros<br />
as long as they don't move next door<br />
So love me, love me, love me, I'm a liberal</p>


<p>The people of old Mississippi<br />
Should all hang their heads in shame<br />
I can't understand how their minds work<br />
What's the matter don't they watch Les Crain?<br />
But if you ask me to bus my children<br />
I hope the cops take down your name<br />
So love me, love me, love me, I'm a liberal</p>


<p>I read New republic and Nation<br />
I've learned to take every view<br />
You know, I've memorized Lerner and Golden<br />
I feel like I'm almost a Jew<br />
But when it comes to times like Korea<br />
There's no one more red, white and blue<br />
So love me, love me, love me, I'm a liberal</p>


<p>I vote for the democratic party<br />
They want the U.N. to be strong<br />
I go to all the Pete Seeger concerts<br />
He sure gets me singing those songs<br />
I'll send all the money you ask for<br />
But don't ask me to come on along<br />
So love me, love me, love me, I'm a liberal</p>


<p>Once I was young and impulsive<br />
I wore every conceivable pin<br />
Even went to the socialist meetings<br />
Learned all the old union hymns<br />
But I've grown older and wiser<br />
And that's why I'm turning you in<br />
So love me, love me, love me, I'm a liberal</p>

			        <p class="teaser_info"><p>There is some good domestic money in the 'rescue package' - but most of it is still secretly lining the pockets of Citigroup. Let us make no mistake - I had a discussion about this yesterday - our financial system is still crumbling, and Obama has TOTALLY sided with the banks. He is only OCCASIONALLY a champion of the people.</p>


<p>Where is the mortgage relief for homeowners? Why is our government paying top dollar for toxic assets, essentially using tax dollars to keep criminal banking interests solvent? Why is the war still growing? Why do banks get bailed out over and over, while auto workers are SOL?</p>


<p>And finally, why are a million people still declaring bankruptcy every year because they can't afford to pay their health care bills? Where is a people's champion for that?</p>


<p>quoted:</p>


<p>Geithner has since pushed the Obama administration to approach the banking crisis not in response to the needs of destitute homeowners but rather from the side of the bankers who are seizing their homes. Instead of keeping people in their homes with a freeze on foreclosures, he has rewarded the unscrupulous lenders who conned ordinary folks.</p>


<p>He still wants to give more money to Citigroup, which has just been found woefully short of cash by Treasury's auditors, and has not stopped Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and some other big banks ostensibly under government influence, and indeed sometimes ownership, from recently ending their temporary moratoriums on housing foreclosures. Geithner has been in the forefront of coddling the banks in the hopes that welfare for the rich will trickle down to suffering homeowners, but that has not happened.</p>

We won't find our keys, and we won't learn how to fight the next war - but what else can we do? It's just as Kierkegaard said - we live forward, but can only understand backward. That's just part of the human condition, the way the world is constructed.</p>

<p>Also, for the record, I think public spending is in essence a good thing. We just have to be careful about political pork, which is what I think this touches on - also, I think the parallel here with the Patriot Act is striking.</p>

Subject: Re: Lost! Tiny blue hat on Carroll St. betw. 8th Ave. &amp; PPW</p>


<p>And yet, she did say "infant's" hat. Why? Is there something ineffably "infant-ish" about the hat? And if the hat is worn by, say, a 9-month old with an unusually small head, does that mean there's something wrong or evil about that 9-month old? Who are we to judge that a hat is "for" an "infant"? What gives us the right to even slap it with the label "hat," when for all we know it's a very soft, porous bowl, or a cozy for a tiny soccer ball? It's throwaway comments like "infant's hat" that hurt me to the quick. </p>

			        <p class="teaser_info"><p>Well, the one good thing I'm getting out of this redesign is that I can dump all of these posts out into the vast night and no one will see them. And so I am able to see how this whole thing shakes out.</p>


<p>I will tell the story, fully hoping that no one will read it, as a strange testament to what gives me pleasure as well as a good example of how sweet technology is.</p>


<p>As some of you know, I make my living as a software developer. It's been about ten years now that I spend about ten dollars for every dollar I make as a songwriter in the process of making songs. The return is there, but without some good seed capital it feels a little like blowing on an ember with your nose. But I digress.<br />
So there I was, growing up as a rockstar and office whore. Trying to make a statement. It was about 8 years ago that both I moved here and I decided to live two lives. I only mention this because I am now announcing that this double life is over. I have married both of my blogs to each other just as I soon will marry my beloved and thus I am saying 'Yes, it may be that I will post both song lyrics and code snippets; I may be both rockstar and nerd and that is just the way of it.'</p>


<p>And so it is. My weird 'why is the server called digbox if the site says codeboxer?' days are over. There will be one server to rule them all.</p>


<p>Hehe, so anyway to finish the story I was trying to consolidate and had some problems moving my 'nerd' blog over to the mothership, so to speak, and finally the light went off. This Drupal 6 is sort of the bomb. Why don't I dump that crappy b2Evolution installation that won't port nicely and just drive all of my posts from TheAxelVault (aka kristeraxel.com)? </p>


<p>So then I'm looking for a way to export b2Evolution and I see that there isn't one. I stumble across a blog post that suggests 'why not just set up a view to aggregate everything you want dumped as an rss feed and do it that way?'</p>


<p>And I say, yeah, why not? Great idea.</p>


<p>So my posts don't look as good as they used to because they got sucked through the SimplePie rss machine but they are there. I did the same thing with my podcast posts. Now I post everything from here, and it shoots out to the appropriate feed lickety split.</p>


<p>But here's the kicker. I used these 2 php libraries (class_http.php and class_xml.php) that I got here <a href="http://www.troywolf.com/articles/php/class_http/" title="http://www.troywolf.com/articles/php/class_http/">http://www.troywolf.com/articles/php/class_http/</a> and I built my own server-side search parser, totally simple and barebones, and it's a self-updating site now. I set up the feed through google and I use the little google script to populate the home page (cached every 60 minutes). The only other page is the search page and it takes search parameters from the GET, sets up it's own little hardcoded tag dictionary on the fly for menu items, and hits the (also cached) rss feed for every search, slices up the xml file according to your search tag, and serves it up. I'm so proud I keep messing with it.</p>


<p>for those who have no idea what I just said, I basically replaced a whole blog site that I used to have to maintain with 2 simple pages that update and search themselves on their own - based on posts that I drive from this site. Talk about simplifying your life!</p>


<p>The only downside is that it will probably kill some old links, but hey, such is life.</p>

<p>*** and now we can talk about it ***</p>

<p>It has been so long since I wrote a blog post.</p>
<p>I used to fill up a whole book per year with  poems and lyrics and such but then when I was in college they invented this thing called the personal computer and I ended up staying in the library all night to use my first email address. And then I bought my own computer. Then I got a laptop.</p>
<p>Now I am sending tweets from my phone that auto post to Facebook and my own website. Soon I will have it so I can email in posts from anywhere. Somewhere along the line I stopped blogging as much, because like mostly every songwriter/geek right now I have a bunch of social profiles to keep updating and it's not as much about writing anymore as it is about <em>connecting</em> what you write. Yikes.</p>
<p>Anyway, I have a gig coming up finally. I think my last one was in November. I sent out an email recently (<a href="http://campaign-archive.com/?u=29744d054bf577181511e20e9&amp;id=c1510a0736" target="_blank">link</a>), and I'm shuffling around my web sites like it's going out of style. I'm still looking to possibly move Ruby hosts, I have done pretty well so far with the ghetto-ish <a href="http://railsplayground.com/" target="_blank">RailsPlayground</a> but I will need to upgrade soon. Other than that, I am dropping both NamesDirect and Hostmonster for a fully centralized account at Dreamhost, and so far I'm pretty happy with it. Dreamhost does leave you out in the cold a little on the support side, but that's why I've been contracting out a little php work lately and it's been working pretty well. Php labor is pretty cheap these days, and I pay my guys well (no matter what they do - from php devs all the way up to studio cats that I bring in for my album projects) so it is all working out famously.</p>
<p>And of course, my peeps at <a href="http://gmg-entertainment.com" target="_blank">GMG</a> are taking good care of me. I got a wedding coming up, dontcha know.</p>

			        <p class="teaser_info"><p>I got forwarded this by the FAIR newsletter - it's a good short read.</p>


<table cellpadding="5">
<tr style="background-color:#ddd;">
<td align='justify'>
<p>Watch out if you live in or visit Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>If you see a camera or microphone, be careful not to be trampled by a politician rushing to shout their 'outrage' at AIG, and its brazen scheme to pay $165 million in bonuses to employees at the company unit responsible for driving the company to the edge of insolvency.</p>
<p>Maybe the politicians really are outraged. (They definitely know their constituents are.) But it would have helped if they had expressed some outrage - and opposition - during the decades-long period of deregulation that brought us the AIG collapse and the financial meltdown.</p>
<p>It is indeed unfathomable that AIG went ahead with the bonus payments, and that the Treasury Department and Federal Reserve failed to act to stop the bonus payments before they were made.</p>
<p>What is vital now is that the public‚s righteous anger is not expressed only as 'no.' There are a lot of things to which We The People do need to say 'no.' But we need a lot of 'yes' too. We need to demand that policymakers impose public controls over the financial sector. The financial sector restraint, shrinkage and displacement agenda is long and diverse, but there are a number of lessons that flow directly from the AIG debacle.</p>
<p>First, the government must exercise much more direct control over the firms it is bailing out (many of which, like AIG, are very likely to be subjected to government takeovers of one kind or another in the coming months). If the government exercised control commensurate with its ownership stake, it could simply refuse to permit outrages like the AIG bonus payments to occur. Beyond preventing outrages, there should be affirmative demands imposed on the beneficiaries of bailout funds. These should include, for commercial banks, the mandatory write down of principal on home mortgages where the outstanding loan amount now exceed the value of the home, and the end to usurious interest rates on credit cards.</p>
<p>Second, there must be far-reaching reform of compensation arrangements in the financial sector. Never again should anyone get away with saying this is a symbolic issue. The AIG bonus payments, and the manic response from the financial sector to modest executive pay restrictions added by Senator Chris Dodd to the financial bailout reauthorization legislation, demonstrate that the guys on Wall Street certainly don‚t think it‚s symbolic. Real reform must go beyond giving shareholders a say on pay to imposing public controls. There should be high tax rates on excessive compensation. Most importantly, there should be a prohibition on incentive pay that is linked to short-term performance. Bonuses based on annual performance give traders and others an incentive to take unreasonable risks - threatening the viability of their firms, and the overall financial system.</p>
<p>Third, the regulatory black holes in the financial system must be eradicated. One black hole concerns regulation of financial derivatives - the exotic instruments that threw AIG into virtual insolvency. During the Clinton administration, Fed Chair Alan Greenspan, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Deputy Treasury Secretary (now director of the National Economic Council) Larry Summers crushed an effort by independent-minded regulators to adopt modest regulation of financial derivatives. In 2000, Congress prohibited such regulation by law. When regulations are finally adopted this year, as they almost certainly will be, they should prohibit certain kinds of financial derivatives altogether, and require that new ones prove their safety and social value before being placed on the market.</p>
<p>Fourth, we need a revitalized antitrust and competition policy to break up and shrink the size of the mega financial institutions (and, not so incidentally, we also need to shrink the size of the overall financial structure). These too-big-to-fail institutions are, as has been said, just too big. Or amended: they are too big and too interconnected. Their very existence poses unacceptable social costs, made worse by the fact they take greater risks knowing that they benefit from an implicit public insurance.</p>
<p>AIG itself has acknowledged the problem. In a company presentation apparently prepared to persuade the federal government to keep the bailout funds coming, AIG explained, 'what happens to AIG has the potential to trigger a cascading set of further failures which cannot be stopped except by extraordinary means.'</p>
<p>AIG CEO Edward Liddy has drawn the proper conclusion: 'Where safeguards are lacking' - and it should be added, it has proven far beyond the capacity of regulators to impose sufficient safeguards - 'such companies need to be restructured or scaled back so they no longer come close to posing a systemic risk.'</p>
<p>Finally, renewed attention must be paid to corporate structure and prohibitions on whole categories of activity. Insurance companies should be prohibited from operating affiliates that function as de facto hedge funds. Commercial banks husbanding depositors‚ assets should be prohibited from operating securities firms (as was law until 1999) or making securities firm-style speculative bets.</p>
<p>Will the outraged politicians demand these and other reforms? Will their outrage last once the media move on to the next story? That will depend almost entirely on whether an organized and focused public demands it.</p>

<tr style="background-color:#ddd;">
<td align='justify'>
<p>Well, this is sort of a test post but it is definitely a think piece. :)</p>
<p>It started when I decided to try to start syncing up all of my 'posts'. That led me to Twitter, which then led me to ping.fm, and of course the google reader has been part and parcel of this all along the way.</p>
<p>The other piece is my home page at kristeraxel.com, which I use to drive posts and to keep my content under my own umbrella. For example, my sister has a beautiful blog over at blogspot, but I wonder what will ever happen if they go under or get bought, I just hate not having control like that. Ditto for pictures, even video. It kills me that people fall over themselves to hand their content to the Flickrs and the Youtubes of the world, when you can pay like $60 a year to keep all your shit to yourself. Hold on to your content, people! Privacy is a big deal too, but it's the short sightedness that gets me. Is anyone backing anything up, or is this generation literally handing itself over, one anecdotal reference at a time, to big business for prompt monetization and eventual subversion? I can see a future where you have to pay YouTube to give you back a copy of the video you uploaded. They'll call it an 'administration fee', and it will probably be more than the 6 bucks per month or so that you have to pay to get a real host with unlimited storage.</p>
<p>But I digress. So here's what is going on:</p>
<p>My Drupal site is linked to Twitter. Twitter posts show up here, and posts on my Drupal site (kristeraxel.com) get auto-synopsized into a Twitter post. Cool!<br />
Those Twitter posts feed into my google reader for easy reference.</p>
<p>I used to have my Facebook account tied to my google reader feed (stay with me here) so that any article I flag to 'share' will pop up as a micro post in FB; but that didn't work too well because the Notes module had this habit of tying all posts in one day into a single 'omni' post, which was not cool. So now, I have tied my FB notes module to my Twitter feed, and I will see if the Twitter updates that get generated from my Drupal site will shoot all the way through to FB - a man can dream. I'll update more when I know for sure. I also found that most good web sources these days have a direct 'post to facebook' option, which renders the whole 'share through google reader' functionality less necessary.</p>
<p>Finally, the kicker is that I can post a status update via ping.fm, and that seems to be able to shoot through to - linkedin, facebook, friendfeed, and Twitter.</p>
<p>Friendfeed I only use to bounce stuff into my Vox account via RSS, but Vox won't let me automate it. I only signed up at Vox for an open_id, and it kind of sucks, but friendfeed is pretty good for aggregating last.fm info with fb status stuff, give you that voice of a proletariat. Sheesh. Lastly, my thesixtyone account seems to have some Twitter interfacing abilities, but I am so tired of u/p combos and dev keys that I am probably going to drink a whole bottle of whiskey before dinner.</p>
<p>So there you have it. </p>
<p>bottom line: Skip Vox, they are not very cool.</p>

<p>This is, once again, an imperial presidency, and I think it's cause for great, great concern. And unfortunately, the spines of many people that actually have the ear of Obama seem to have been surgically removed now that he is president.</p>

			        <p class="teaser_info"><p>Goldman spokesman Michael DuVally says no tarp money is going to bonuses: "The compensation that was paid to employees came out of our business activities.” Charles Geisst, finance professor at Manhattan College and author of the upcoming Collateral Damaged: The Marketing of Consumer Debt to America, begs to differ. "If they didn't have the tarp money, they would be forced to raise fresh capital,” he says. "Now, I agree it's a long-term item on the balance sheet. But [without the government money] they would have to take a dip into what operating profits they have left, and reduce those salaries. So the tarp money is a substitute. Theirs is an extremely disingenuous argument.” Counters DuVally, "Professor Geisst is wrong. We paid bonuses out of earnings, not capital.” But as former compensation consultant Graef Crystal put it on Bloomberg.com, "The argument of saying we're not using the bailout money is just crap because money's fungible. Money's money. It exposes them to ridicule.”</p>

<p>End of June actually.</p>


<p>So of course, I have a wedding album to make which will contain some new songs and some unreleased old songs. I don't have a name for it yet, but it is going to be awesome.</p>


<p>To go along with that, I have a show coming up in April again at the Santa Monica Farmer's market and then that will probably be it for a while. 5 albums in 6 years means I get to take a break. :)</p>




<p>And I could use some more comments in the Apple Store, so thanks for your support!</p>

<p>added - tentative track list:</p>


<p>Sweet Thing<br />
When They Come To Take Me In<br />
Keep Me Here<br />
Mona Lisa<br />
Sunshine<br />
Still Feels Broken<br />
Georgia On My Mind</p>

From California, to the New York Island<br />

I saw above me an endless skyway<br />
I saw below me a golden valley<br />
This land was made for you and me</p>

<p>I've roamed and rambled and I've followed my footsteps<br />
To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts<br />
And all around me a voice was sounding<br />
This land was made for you and me</p>

The wheat fields waving and the dust clouds rolling<br />
The fog was lifting a voice come chanting<br />
This land was made for you and me</p>

<p>There was a big high wall there that tried to stop me;<br />
Sign was painted, it said private property;<br />
But on the back side it didn't say nothing;<br />
That side was made for you and me.</p>


<p>Chorus</p>


<p>In the shadow of the steeple I saw my people,<br />
By the relief office I seen my people;<br />
As they stood there hungry, I stood there whistling<br />
Is this land made for you and me?</p>

<p>Nobody living can ever stop me,<br />
As I go walking that freedom highway;<br />
Nobody living can ever make me turn back<br />
This land was made for you and me.</p>

			        <p class="teaser_info"><p>On November 4th, here [the] record is clear: Israel broke the ceasefire by going into Gaza and killing six or seven Palestinian militants. At that point—and now I'm quoting the official Israeli website—Hamas retaliated or, in retaliation for the Israeli attack, then launched the missiles. -Norman Finkelstein, quoted JAN 8, 2009 on <a href="http://democracynow.org" title="http://democracynow.org">http://democracynow.org</a>.</p>


<p><a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2009/1/8/former_amb_martin_indyk_vs_author" title="http://www.democracynow.org/2009/1/8/former_amb_martin_indyk_vs_author">http://www.democracynow.org/2009/1/8/former_amb_martin_indyk_vs_author</a></p>


<p><a href="http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/" title="http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/">http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/</a></p>


<p>continued:</p>


<p>Now, as to the reason why, the record is fairly clear as well. According to Ha'aretz, Defense Minister Barak began plans for this invasion before the ceasefire even began. In fact, according to yesterday's Ha'aretz, the plans for the invasion began in March. And the main reasons for the invasion, I think, are twofold. Number one, as Mr. Indyk I think correctly points out, to enhance what Israel calls its deterrence capacity, which in layman's language basically means Israel's capacity to terrorize the region into submission. After their defeat in July 2006 in Lebanon, they felt it important to transmit the message that Israel is still a fighting force, still capable of terrorizing those who dare defy its word.</p>


<p>And the second main reason for the attack is because Hamas was signaling that it wanted a diplomatic settlement of the conflict along the June 1967 border. That is to say, Hamas was signaling they had joined the international consensus, they had joined most of the international community, overwhelmingly the international community, in seeking a diplomatic settlement. And at that point, Israel was faced with what Israelis call a Palestinian peace offensive. And in order to defeat the peace offensive, they sought to dismantle Hamas.</p>

			        <p class="teaser_info"><p>President George W. Bush will leave behind a legacy of Bushisms, the label stamped on the commander in chief's original speaking style. Some of the president's more notable malaprops and mangled statements:</p>

<p>• "I can't wait to join you in the joy of welcoming neighbors back into neighborhoods, and small businesses up and running, and cutting those ribbons that somebody is creating new jobs." — Sept. 5, 2005, when Bush met with residents of Poplarville, Miss., in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.</p>


<p>• "It was not always a given that the United States and America would have a close relationship. After all, 60 years we were at war 60 years ago we were at war." — June 29, 2006, at the White House, where Bush met with Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi.</p>


<p>• "Make no mistake about it, I understand how tough it is, sir. I talk to families who die." — Dec. 7, 2006, in a joint appearance with British Prime Minister Tony Blair.</p>

<p>• "The people in Louisiana must know that all across our country there's a lot of prayer — prayer for those whose lives have been turned upside down. And I'm one of them.

			        <p class="teaser_info"><p>A Wal-Mart worker died early Friday after an "out-of-control" mob of frenzied shoppers smashed through the Long Island store's front doors and trampled him, police said.</p>


<p>The Black Friday stampede plunged the Valley Stream outlet into chaos, knocking several employees to the ground and sending others scurrying atop vending machines to avoid the horde.</p>


<p>When the madness ended, 34-year-old Jdimytai Damour was dead and four shoppers, including a woman eight months pregnant, were injured.<br />
CAUGHT ON CAMERA: WAL-MART CROWD MOMENTS BEFORE DEADLY STAMPEDE</p>


<p>"He was bum-rushed by 200 people," said Wal-Mart worker Jimmy Overby, 43.</p>


<p>"They took the doors off the hinges. He was trampled and killed in front of me.</p>


<p>"They took me down, too ... I didn't know if I was going to live through it. I literally had to fight people off my back," Overby said.</p>


<p>Damour, a temporary maintenance worker from Jamaica, Queens, was gasping for air as shoppers continued to surge into the store after its 5 a.m. opening, witnesses said.</p>


<p>Even officers who arrived to perform CPR on the trampled worker were stepped on by wild-eyed shoppers streaming inside, a cop at the scene said.</p>


<p>"They pushed him down and walked all over him," Damour's sobbing sister, Danielle, 41, said. "How could these people do that?</p>


<p>"He was such a young man with a good heart, full of life. He didn't deserve that."</p>


<p>Damour's sister said doctors told the family he died of a heart attack.</p>


<p>His cousin, Ernst Damour, called the circumstances "completely unacceptable."</p>


<p>"His body was a stepping bag with so much disregard for human life," Ernst Damour, 37, said. "There has to be some accountability."</p>


<p>Roughly 2,000 people gathered outside the Wal-Mart's doors in the predawn darkness.</p>


<p>Chanting "push the doors in," the crowd pressed against the glass as the clock ticked down to the 5 a.m. opening.</p>


<p>Sensing catastrophe, nervous employees formed a human chain inside the entrance to slow down the mass of shoppers.</p>


<p>It didn't work.</p>


<p>The mob barreled in and overwhelmed workers.</p>


<p>"They were jumping over the barricades and breaking down the door," said Pat Alexander, 53, of Crown Heights, Brooklyn. "Everyone was screaming. You just had to keep walking on your toes to keep from falling over."</p>


<p>After the throng toppled Damour, his fellow employees had to fight through the crowd to help him, police said.</p>


<p>Witness Kimberly Cribbs said shoppers acted like "savages."</p>


<p>"When they were saying they had to leave, that an employee got killed, people were yelling, 'I've been on line since Friday morning!'" Cribbs said. "They kept shopping." </p>


<p>When paramedics arrived, Damour's condition was grave.</p>


<p>"They were pumping his chest, trying to bring him back, and there was nothing," said Dennis Smokes, 36, a Wal-Mart worker.</p>


<p>Damour was taken to Franklin Hospital and pronounced dead at 6:03 a.m.</p>


<p>Hank Mullany, president of Wal-Mart's northeast division, said the company took extraordinary safety precautions.</p>


<p>"We expected a large crowd this morning and added additional internal security, additional third-party security, additional store associates and we worked closely with the Nassau County police," he said in a statement.</p>


<p>"We also erected barricades. Despite all of our precautions, this unfortunate event occurred."</p>


<p>The 28-year-old pregnant woman and three other shoppers were taken to area hospitals with minor injuries, police said.</p>


<p>In a news conference after the incident, Nassau County police spokesman Lt. Michael Fleming described the crowd as "out of control" and the scene as "utter chaos." He said Wal-Mart did not have enough security onhand.</p>


<p>Fleming said criminal charges were possible but that it would be difficult to identify individual shoppers in surveillance videos.</p>


<p>Items on sale at the Wal-Mart store included a $798 Samsung 50-inch Plasma HDTV, a Bissel Compact Upright Vacuum for $28 and Men's Wrangler Tough Jeans for $8.</p>


<p>The Long Island store reopened at 1 p.m. and was packed within minutes.</p>


<p>"I look at these people's faces and I keep thinking one of them could have stepped on him," said one employee. "How could you take a man's life to save $20 on a TV?"</p>

			        <p class="teaser_info"><p>In his own words:</p>


<p>We should reform and strengthen multilateral institutions ... by 100,000 more troops. We must protect our homeland and civil liberties by creating a new domestic counterterrorism force like Britain's MI5.</p>


<p>full story:</p>


<p>What are Emanuel's views on war and peace? Emanuel has just supplied the answer in the form of a scrawny book co-authored with Bruce Reed, modestly entitled: The Plan: Big Ideas for America. The authors obligingly boil each of the eight parts of "The Plan" down to a single paragraph. The section which embraces all of foreign policy is entitled "A New Strategy to End the War on Terror," a heading revealing in itself since "war on terror" is the way the neocons and the Israeli Lobby currently like to frame the discussion of foreign policy. Here is the book's summary paragraph with my comments in parentheses:</p>


<p>"A New Strategy to Win the War on Terror"<br />
("War on Terror," as George Soros points out, is a false metaphor used by those who would drag us into military adventures not in our interest or that of humanity.)</p>


<p>"We need to use all the roots of American power to make our country safe. (He begins by playing on fear.) America must lead the world's fight against the spread of evil and totalitarianism, but we must stop trying to win that battle on our own. (Messianic imperialism.) We should reform and strengthen multilateral institutions for the twenty-first century, not walk away from them. We need to fortify the military's "thin green line" around the world by adding to the U.S. Special Forces and the Marines, and by expanding the U.S. army by 100,000 more troops. (An even bigger military for the world's most powerful armed forces, a very militaristic view of the way to handle the conflicts among nations. What uses does Emanuel have in mind for those troops?) We should give our troops a new GI Bill to come home to. (More material incentives to induce the financially strapped to sign up as cannon fodder.) Finally we must protect our homeland and civil liberties by creating a new domestic counterterrorism force like Britain's MI5. (A new domestic spying operation is an obvious threat to our civil liberties; MI5 holds secret files on one in 160 adults in Britain along with files on 53,000 organizations.)</p>

If we don't start leaning on the Obama administration really hard, we will wake up next year with a foreign policy agenda that is even further right than Bill Clinton's was - i.e., no change at all.<br />

<p>Making matters worse, or more widespread throughout the economy, just as with mortgage debt, credit card debt is put into pools that are then resold to investment houses, other banks and institutional investors. About 45 percent of the nation's $900-plus billion in credit card debt has been packaged into these pools, and so many companies, not just a few, are at risk of being forced out of business by credit card debt write-offs.</p>

<p>3rd Infantry's 1st BCT trains for a new dwell-time mission. Helping ‘people at home' may become a permanent part of the active Army<br />
By Gina Cavallaro - Staff writer<br />

<p>The 3rd Infantry Division's 1st Brigade Combat Team has spent 35 of the last 60 months in Iraq patrolling in full battle rattle, helping restore essential services and escorting supply convoys.</p>


<p>Now they're training for the same mission — with a twist — at home.</p>


<p>Beginning Oct. 1 for 12 months, the 1st BCT will be under the day-to-day control of U.S. Army North, the Army service component of Northern Command, as an on-call federal response force for natural or manmade emergencies and disasters, including terrorist attacks.</p>


<p>It is not the first time an active-duty unit has been tapped to help at home. In August 2005, for example, when Hurricane Katrina unleashed hell in Mississippi and Louisiana, several active-duty units were pulled from various posts and mobilized to those areas.</p>


<p>But this new mission marks the first time an active unit has been given a dedicated assignment to NorthCom, a joint command established in 2002 to provide command and control for federal homeland defense efforts and coordinate defense support of civil authorities.</p>


<p>After 1st BCT finishes its dwell-time mission, expectations are that another, as yet unnamed, active-duty brigade will take over and that the mission will be a permanent one.</p>


<p>"Right now, the response force requirement will be an enduring mission. How the [Defense Department] chooses to source that and whether or not they continue to assign them to NorthCom, that could change in the future,” said Army Col. Louis Vogler, chief of NorthCom future operations. "Now, the plan is to assign a force every year.”</p>


<p>The command is at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado Springs, Colo., but the soldiers with 1st BCT, who returned in April after 15 months in Iraq, will operate out of their home post at Fort Stewart, Ga., where they'll be able to go to school, spend time with their families and train for their new homeland mission as well as the counterinsurgency mission in the war zones.</p>


<p>Stop-loss will not be in effect, so soldiers will be able to leave the Army or move to new assignments during the mission, and the operational tempo will be variable.</p>


<p>Don't look for any extra time off, though. The at-home mission does not take the place of scheduled combat-zone deployments and will take place during the so-called dwell time a unit gets to reset and regenerate after a deployment.</p>


<p>The 1st of the 3rd is still scheduled to deploy to either Iraq or Afghanistan in early 2010, which means the soldiers will have been home a minimum of 20 months by the time they ship out.</p>


<p>In the meantime, they'll learn new skills, use some of the ones they acquired in the war zone and more than likely will not be shot at while doing any of it.</p>


<p>They may be called upon to help with civil unrest and crowd control or to deal with potentially horrific scenarios such as massive poisoning and chaos in response to a chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear or high-yield explosive, or CBRNE, attack.</p>


<p>Training for homeland scenarios has already begun at Fort Stewart and includes specialty tasks such as knowing how to use the "jaws of life” to extract a person from a mangled vehicle; extra medical training for a CBRNE incident; and working with U.S. Forestry Service experts on how to go in with chainsaws and cut and clear trees to clear a road or area.</p>


<p>The 1st BCT's soldiers also will learn how to use "the first ever nonlethal package that the Army has fielded,” 1st BCT commander Col. Roger Cloutier said, referring to crowd and traffic control equipment and nonlethal weapons designed to subdue unruly or dangerous individuals without killing them.</p>


<p>The package is for use only in war-zone operations, not for any domestic purpose.</p>


<p>"It's a new modular package of nonlethal capabilities that they're fielding. They've been using pieces of it in Iraq, but this is the first time that these modules were consolidated and this package fielded, and because of this mission we're undertaking we were the first to get it.”</p>


<p>The package includes equipment to stand up a hasty road block; spike strips for slowing, stopping or controlling traffic; shields and batons; and, beanbag bullets.</p>


<p>"I was the first guy in the brigade to get Tasered,” said Cloutier, describing the experience as "your worst muscle cramp ever — times 10 throughout your whole body.</p>


<p>"I'm not a small guy, I weigh 230 pounds ... it put me on my knees in seconds.”</p>


<p>The brigade will not change its name, but the force will be known for the next year as a CBRNE Consequence Management Response Force, or CCMRF (pronounced "sea-smurf”).</p>


<p>"I can't think of a more noble mission than this,” said Cloutier, who took command in July. "We've been all over the world during this time of conflict, but now our mission is to take care of citizens at home ... and depending on where an event occurred, you're going home to take care of your home town, your loved ones.”</p>


<p>While soldiers' combat training is applicable, he said, some nuances don't apply.</p>


<p>"If we go in, we're going in to help American citizens on American soil, to save lives, provide critical life support, help clear debris, restore normalcy and support whatever local agencies need us to do, so it's kind of a different role,” said Cloutier, who, as the division operations officer on the last rotation, learned of the homeland mission a few months ago while they were still in Iraq.</p>


<p>Some brigade elements will be on call around the clock, during which time they'll do their regular marksmanship, gunnery and other deployment training. That's because the unit will continue to train and reset for the next deployment, even as it serves in its CCMRF mission.</p>


<p>Should personnel be needed at an earthquake in California, for example, all or part of the brigade could be scrambled there, depending on the extent of the need and the specialties involved.<br />
Other branches included</p>


<p>The active Army's new dwell-time mission is part of a NorthCom and DOD response package.</p>


<p>Active-duty soldiers will be part of a force that includes elements from other military branches and dedicated National Guard Weapons of Mass Destruction-Civil Support Teams.</p>


<p>A final mission rehearsal exercise is scheduled for mid-September at Fort Stewart and will be run by Joint Task Force Civil Support, a unit based out of Fort Monroe, Va., that will coordinate and evaluate the interservice event.</p>


<p>In addition to 1st BCT, other Army units will take part in the two-week training exercise, including elements of the 1st Medical Brigade out of Fort Hood, Texas, and the 82nd Combat Aviation Brigade from Fort Bragg, N.C.</p>


<p>There also will be Air Force engineer and medical units, the Marine Corps Chemical, Biological Initial Reaction Force, a Navy weather team and members of the Defense Logistics Agency and the Defense Threat Reduction Agency.</p>


<p>One of the things Vogler said they'll be looking at is communications capabilities between the services.</p>


<p>"It is a concern, and we're trying to check that and one of the ways we do that is by having these sorts of exercises. Leading up to this, we are going to rehearse and set up some of the communications systems to make sure we have interoperability,” he said.</p>


<p>"I don't know what America's overall plan is — I just know that 24 hours a day, seven days a week, there are soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines that are standing by to come and help if they're called,” Cloutier said. "It makes me feel good as an American to know that my country has dedicated a force to come in and help the people at home.”</p>

			        <p class="teaser_info"><p>January 2008: Countrywide Financial bank collapses (assets US$ 172 billion)</p>


<p>March 2008: Investment bank Bear Stearns (assets for $399 billion) collapses and is acquired by JPMorgan Chase through a FED-funded credit for $ 30 billion.&lt;!--break--> On March 7, the FED offers up to $ 200 billion in 28-day loans to banks and large financial institutions. On March 11, the FED offers investment banks up to $200 billion in Treasury Securities in exchange for mortgage-backed securities. On March 21st, the European Central Bank offered up to $ 24 billion in loans to help banks shore up balance sheets. The Bank of England in turn offers up to $ 10 billion in loans.</p>


<p>April 2008: Commercial bank IndyMac Bancorp collapses (assets for $32.3 billion). German bank DÃ¼sseldorfer Hypotheken Bank (assets for $ 42.5 billion) collapses. July 2008: UK bank Alliance &amp; Leicester (assets for $153.40 billion) collapses. Danish bank Roskilde Bank (assets for $ 7.9 billion) collapses.</p>


<p>7 September 2008: The US's two largest mortgage agencies - Freddie Mac (assetsts for $ 879 billion) and Fannie Mae (assets for $ 885.9 billion) are taken over by the FED, at a direct cost of $ 200 billion, and the US Government now owns their $ 5.4 trillion combined debt</p>


<p>15 September 2008: The US's fourth largest investment bank, Lehman Brothers (assets for $ 966.2 billion) collapses. At the same time, investment bank Merrill Lynch (assets for $ 639.4 billion) is bailed out by Bank of America at a cost of $ 50 billion (unofficially funded by the FED, considering Bank of America did not have funds for such an acquisition)</p>


<p>16 September 2008: The central banks of the US, European Union UK, Japan, Switzerland and Canada set up a $ 180 billion emergency currency swap fund</p>


<p>17 September 2008: The largest insurance company in the US and the world, American International Group (AIG) (assets for $ 1.050 trillion), is nationalized 80% by the FED at a cost of $ 85 billion. The decision to salvage this insurance company (a decision that should have been taken by State insurance commissioners, not the FED) lies in the fact that it would have dragged down key banks like Goldman Sachs. This explains why Goldman's CEO Lloyd C. Blankfein, was the only Wall Street banker invited to participate in the last minute bail-out talks by FED governor Bernard B. Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson. Notably, before becoming George W Bush's Treasury Secretary in June 2006, Paulson was CEO of Goldman Sachs, at which time he was replaced by Blankfein.</p>


<p>19 September 2008: Henry Paulson, Bernard Shalom Bernanke and Christopher Cox (chairman of the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission - SEC) submitted to Congress an urgent 3-page Bail-out Plan (similar in style to Argentina's "financial armouring" of December 2000 which paved the way for 2001's total financial meltdown), to the tune of $ 700 billion which is supposed to stop further banking and financial failures in the US and worldwide. The urgency of the matter could be read in their panicky faces and the bill crashed in the House of Representative which rejected it on 22-Sept-08. It has since then grown to a 450-page dossier, now approved by the Senate and being resubmitted to the House.</p>


<p>Paulson and Bernanke seek "superpowers" from Congress, similar to the ones that former economy minister Domingo Cavallo wrenched from Argentina's Congress in 2001, which led to total collapse. In various declarations, president George W Bush stressed time and again the dire situation of this "national emergency". When asked how the amount of $ 700 billion was arrived at, Bernanke replied that it represents 5% (!!!) of mortgages that have become non-performing. Independent analysts, however, reckon that this 5% is insufficient to cover all bail-outs and that we need to look at 10, 15 or 20 percent of non-performing mortgages, which would turn bail-out figures into unfathomable amounts. Rejection of the bail-out plan on "Bloody Monday" led to a collapse of the Dow Jones Industrial Index by 778 points (more than 7%) and a 16% fall for financial institutions. Not surprisingly, in their 21st September edition the London newspaper "The Daily Telegraph" pointed out that we may be edging towards a US Government default on its entire $ 13.5 trillion debt.</p>


<p>The two remaining investment banks still considered to be "healthy" - i.e., prestigious Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley - decided to voluntarily become commercial banks, and thus accept greater regulatory scrutiny. Meanwhile and as a transitory emergency measure, financier Warren Buffet took a $ 5 billion stake in Goldman Sachs to help it become "more healthy", a clear indication of just how critical the situation is.</p>


<p>22 September 2008: After a strange period of silence regarding its situation as a major bank, CitiGroup finally appeared on the scene helping to engineer two bank bail-outs: Washington Mutual Savings &amp; Loan (the largest thrift in the US with assets for $ 309.7 billion), and Wachovia Bank (assets for $ 812.4 billion), although Wachovia is having second thoughts and may strike a deal with Wells Fargo.</p>


<p>September 22nd to 30th: The contagion crosses the Atlantic sending Europe into a crisis with a series of domino-like bank collapses:</p>


<p>Fortis (France-Belgium banking and insurance consortium with assets of $ 1.533 billion) is bailed out by the governments of Belgium, The Netherlands and Luxembourg Bradford &amp; Bigley, major UK Savings &amp; Loans association is rescued by the Spanish Santander Group at a cost of $ 30 billion, assets: $ 104 billion, Hypo Real Estate AG, a German bank bailed out by the government at a cost of $ 50 billion - with assets for $ 622.2 billion, Dexia - another Franco-Belgian bank rescued by their respective governments - Price tag: $ 9.2 billion - assets $ 913 billion, Glitnir (a major Icelandic bank nationalized 75% by the government at a cost of $ 900 billion; assets for $ 48.9 billion). Clearly, these amounts are truly staggering as in their aggregate they are greater than the United States' Gross Domestic Product, which gives a taste of things to come, considering that rumors of further banks failures on both sides of the Atlantic still continue: UniCredit, a pan-European bank based in Italy, which owns the German HypoVereinsbank and the Bank Austria.</p>


<p>UBS based in Zurich, Switzerland, and National City Corporation, Downey Financial Corporation and Sovereign Bancorp, of the United States - all these and more have high risk exposures to "toxic" mortgage securities, to use the charming term coined by Bernanke from the FED... Lastly, major press media and international analysts insist that the bill for these bail-outs will fall on "US Taxpayers" through future tax hikes. This is clearly only a half-truth. The full truth is that, as far as the US is concerned, the bulk of these bail-outs will be paid with even more uncontrolled monetary emission by the FED, which will further erode the value of the Dollar. In short, the cost for this disaster will be paid by companies, governments and individuals who have US-Dollar denominated assets throughout the world, and not just by the "American Taxpayers".<br /><a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article20939.htm">more info</a></p>

McCain's rider exempted the military from conducting any environmental review of its programs.</p>

<p>Personally, I'm much more a fan of Kucinich's speech. A statement like that is really just ignorant. A half-term governor talks about 'clean coal' and being a 'hockey mom' and the right goes into seizures. Can no-one smell the shit anymore?<br />

<p>[Bush], who has been condemned throughout his presidency for failing to tackle climate change, ended a private meeting with the words: "Goodbye from the world's biggest polluter."</p>


<p>He then punched the air while grinning widely, as the rest of those present including Gordon Brown and Nicolas Sarkozy looked on in shock.</p>

<p>Mr Bush, whose second and final term as President ends at the end of the year, then left the meeting at the Windsor Hotel in Hokkaido where the leaders of the world's richest nations had been discussing new targets to cut carbon emissions.</p>


<p>One official who witnessed the extraordinary scene said afterwards: "Everyone was very surprised that he was making a joke about America's record on pollution."</p>


<p>Mr Bush also faced criticism at the summit after Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian Prime Minister, was described in the White House press pack given to journalists as one of the "most controversial leaders in the history of a country known for government corruption and vice".</p>


<p>The White House apologised for what it called "sloppy work" and said an official had simply lifted the characterisation from the internet without reading it.</p>


<p>Concluding the three-day event, leaders from the G8 and developing countries proclaimed a "shared vision" on climate change. However, they failed to bridge differences between rich and emerging nations on curbing emissions. </p>

After all these years, I just never really got the response from handing out flyers a few months in advance that I was looking for. It is a very Los Angeles thing to do, handing out little pocket flyers to everyone in the club on the weekends literally 8-10 weeks in advance of your show, the idea being that said flyer sort of ends up on a fridge or a coffee-table somewhere, sending out ripples of free viral advertising. I don't buy it. I think that rather, what happens is people resent the intrusion subconsciously, and have a number of weeks to feel increasingly guilty about the fact that they (somewhat irrationally) resent the idea of committing themselves to a course of action so far in advance. This mental process continues logically to the point where even if they are free, they don't want to go out as much because they at some point classified the event as a non-option. That's my 2 cents worth of amateur psychoanalysis.<br /><br />
So, if you are missing the Axel and want to hear some good music, please click below to view the details. There is no pre-committal. You can decide to go or not go on your own schedule. Because at the end of the day, I've got my own vehicle for free viral advertising - it's called a website.</p>

			        <p class="teaser_info"><p>Oh yeah, and a war that costs a million dollars a minute. <br />
I was in San Francisco (S.F.) this weekend, and I happened to read an article in the S.F. Chronicle, which to my knowledge is a reputable new source. I am used to mainstream media butchering reality, but I guess this story riles me extra because Northern California is (purportedly) a haven of progressivism. Anyway, in a classic case of both irresponsible journalism and academic blowing smoke up your ass,  Sam Zuckerman really misses the point.</p>


<p>The link to the original article is below, but many of you won't read it so allow me to just quote the passages that are especially odious.</p>


<p><i>In effect, the United States has maxed out on its national credit card. Like it or not, that's one of the most important things now forcing a new standard of frugality on free-spending Americans.</i></p>


<p>Without mentioning the root causes for this phenomenon in terms of both political and fiscal accountability, Sam is either trying too hard to snare readers or worse, deliberately missing the point. The truth is that the only reason the credit spigot is drawing down is because the World Bank, the Fed, and the US government are being run by a bunch of elite-obsessed jackasses. It's not that I'm in favor of more US federal deficit spending but insinuating that somehow the US consumer 'had this coming' is a little like blaming the tree for totaling the car in a DWI. Paul Wolfowitz, Ben Bernanke and George Bush are <i>still</i> drunk behind the wheel. Alan Greenspan deserves his share of the blame as well.</p>


<p>another quote:<br />
<i>As difficult as the adjustment may be, experts say the change is important medicine. To take one example, we're moving into a period when loan standards are more realistic. Home buyers now have to put money down and pay interest appropriate for their level of creditworthiness.</i></p>


<p>It is positively ludicrous to suggest that it takes a complete meltdown of the domestic financial sector to impose common-sense regulations. Isn't that part of the mandate for the Federal Reserve in the first place, to ensure price stability? And who are these 'experts', anyway?</p>


<p>This is what Sam lists as his sources: Chronicle research, BudgetSavvyMag.com</p>


<p>Really? A staff writer for a respected newspaper in a progressive  and academic community quotes nothing reputable for a front page story in the Sunday edition? BudgetSavvyMag.com is hardly a source for anything but shopping tips, and 'Chronicle research' in essence means nothing at all coming from said journalist. If listing oneself as a source is now kosher then the logical end is one writer with multiple pseudonyms quoting himself religiously and to great effect within the letter of the law.</p>


<p>It pains me to know that most of the US will never really know where this credit storm came from. At the risk of oversimplifying, I will just put it this way:<br />
<b>Unregulated capital:</b> Since Reagan and his voodoo economics in the 1980s, the US financial sector has been systematically deregulated. One net effect of this change was that 'reserves' were no longer monitored in a meaningful way. Think of a blackjack addict who is forced to put 40-50% of his paycheck into a savings account every weekend BEFORE he goes to the casino. And then one day, that is a rule that he no longer has to follow (see <a href="http://www.wsws.org/articles/1999/nov1999/bank-n01.shtml" target="_blank">this article</a> for more info).</p>


<p><b>Predatory lending:</b> See above, once all of this newly unregulated cash was on the market, it had to be put somewhere. Enter 'sub-prime borrowers'. Overnight, the mortgage industry invented a new loan consumer class and started marketing mortgages very aggressively to anyone with a pulse. Most of these sub-prime borrowers had no idea what they were in for. Many of them did not even speak english. Greenspan and then Bernanke made it worse by (a) looking the other way for these shady loans and (b) feeding the credit bubble by keeping interest rates low.</p>


<p>Anyway, I have now concluded that 99% of mainstream media is pure doggerel. Sam leaves out enough important points to fill a grain silo. The blogs I read on SmirkingChimp.com are routinely more insightful and far more academically sound, both in terms of footnotes and logical argument. Let us all be thankful for the independent political blogging community sticking to the facts and using quotable sources, because writers like Sam Zuckerman are really stinking up the place.</p>

<p>There is something really wrong here. I have a new job, I've been working in this new office in Santa Monica which I walk to (sweet!), and I just happened to find myself examining a copy of US Weekly. We don't have a lot of magazines up in here, so cut me a break. Anyway, this is the extent of political coverage in it - I looked through the whole thing for something mildly political and/or cerebral.</p>


<p>Here it is -<br />
<b><br />
Heidi Montag, who has been hailed as a feminist hero, is voting for John McCain. 'I am a republican, and he has a lot of experience', says Heidi, who grew up in Colorado. </b></p>


<p>That's it - that is the entire reference. Young girls everywhere are being taught that a vacuous statement like that could (a) come from someone hailed as a 'feminist hero', (b) somehow equate to political awareness. Sheesh.</p>


<p>Oh yeah, and by the way, she has been <i>hailed by some</i> as a 'feminist hero' because - wait for it - she had a mean boyfriend once. I swear, you can't make this stuff up. I don't know who she is, apparently she is on TV somewhere, but she is being quoted by a publication with a readership in the millions that targets a very specific tween + teen demographic, and that makes her a significant role model as sad as it is to say that. Conclusion: we need better role models.<br />
<i><br />
Melman ... went further to argue that military production has a kind of viral impact across the economy, that sickens the whole system. One example: if investors see higher returns in military industries, they will shift their investments away from other industries, leaving them starved for capital.<br />

Of course, there's not a whole lot to say, except that he would make the same kind of jackass president that George is. Sadly, that fact is barely enough to make the news, what with all the hollerin' and carryings-on over in the Finance sector, except we're not even hearing much of a story about that these days.

			        <p class="teaser_info"><p>I am almost ready to mix my new album <a href="http://axelradio.com/album/fast-train">Fast Train</a>.</p>


<p>This is my first album ever that will have been recorded entirely analog - no computers anywhere!</p>


<p>I've got three reels of 2 inch tape in my closet, and it feels positively retro. Not to mention the sound - this is the biggest sounding recording of mine, ever.</p>


<p>I've been working with a few different engineers, Mike Terry and Doug Messenger, and we've been talking about getting a new sound going for me. I like to change it up for every recording.</p>


<p>Swexico (2004) was my first recording, and it is now officially out of stock.

the previous albums:

<p><a href="http://axelradio.com/album/permanent-friday-night">Permanent Friday Night</a> (2005) has a very blues/folk slant to it, and is a real tribute to my early years here in Los Angeles. It is a long play, and really feels like a trip through my past - it's very autobiographical and honest.</p>
<p><a href="http://axelradio.com/album/arms-around-the-river">Arms Around the River</a> (2007) is quite a bit more polished than the first two, and has more of a dreamy sound to it. It is probably most akin to folk/pop records like David Gray's A New Day at Midnight.</p>
<p><a href="http://axelradio.com/album/fast-train">Fast Train</a> (2008) will achieve a middle ground between the last two records - taking off a few coats of polish and finding the organic warmth that you can only get from those old 2 inch tape machines, and featuring some of my best writing yet. It is set to be released in May but I will preview at least a track or two on my <a href="http://inmusic.org">podcast</a>.</p>

Just for the record, I'm not really  against Obama, I just thought we could do better. I do recognize how monumental a black president would be for this country, but it just reminds me of how excited we were in 2006 about the Democratic sweep in Congress - and look where that got us.
<p>Anyway, I just hope this is more than another chance to go through the motions. I want to believe. Sure, I'd like a Dennis Kucinich, or a Ralph Nader, but I suppose I'll settle for a Barack and just try to look at the bright side.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, I think the nicest thing I can say about Barack is that he's no G.W. Bush - and that, my friends, ain't nothin - I guess that's a good place to start. That, and if he really means what he says, then we may get our <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15358236/page/2/">habeus corpus</a> back, and I think there are a good number of additional issues that would we see eye to eye on. So I'm cautiously optimistic.

<p>With the only two remaining Democrats leaning middle-right and middle-righter, I like the sound of a Nader candidacy. I heard him on the radio, and he used two bad-ass scrabble words in the same sentence - pernicious and profligate. Sweet. Take that, Georgie. I swear, it will be the beginning of a new age when we finally have smart people making the decisions again. Good on ya, Ralph.</p>

Despite about 30 years of precedent, the Bush regime decides to deny California's request to go above and beyond Federal greenhouse emissions regulations, which by all accounts are inadequate. The reason? It would be confusing.<br />
Thanks George, that's a really good one. We can't clean up the air, it's too confusing!<br />

I already like an album that has a song called Impeach Bush.
These songs were written around the time of the London Terrorist attack in 2005. He was there and saw how it affected the people living in and around [London].
Axel has a sort of slow, drawly vocal style. His voice is very infectious. I could listen to it all day. The songwriting is bluesy, with lots of rhythm and heartfelt lyrics. Good stuff.

<p><strong>a poem written in Mae Sot<br />
04.01.07</strong><br /></p>

<br />


<p>I found this today in a notebook I had with me over Christmas.
This was written the morning after I spent my first night in Mae Sot (Thailand).</p>

<br /><br /><br />


<p><i>A dog barks at the morning prayer<br />
and the sky remembers everything<br /></p>

<p>the smoke-filled houses<br />
leaned against each other<br />
the wild green hand of nature<br />
clutching at humanity. Go ahead<br />
and die, says the world<br />
we will not find you<br />
in your toothpick temples<br />
eating rice and leaves. Your children<br />
are not lucky enough to feel<br />
the breath of medicine.<br />
There is no love to spare.</i><br /></p>

<p>The pictures from Thailand and Burma are now here. <br /><br /></p>

<p>The story:<br /><br />
Last year in December, both Lavinia and I traveled to Thailand to visit her mother Selia who has volunteered for almost a year now as a teacher's teacher for an organization called <b>The Curriculum Project</b>. We spent most of our time in Mae Sot, which is an important border town between Thailand and Burma.<br />
Many of the Burmese refugee camps are in this area. Most Burmese refugees are of Karen descent, and are the only remaining freedom fighters against the heavy-handed Burmese government - since the Buddhist Karenni faction sold out to the Burmese military regime just a few years ago. There is always hope that these kind-hearted Burmese peasants will find peace and prosperity some day soon. Click the contact link above left if you would like to donate directly to the orphans in the photos depicted here.<br /><br />
While we were there, General Bo Mya passed away in his late seventies, who was easily the most important spokesperson for the Christian Karen faction. Bo Mya was quite literally a folk hero and military legend. Attending his funeral in Burma (Myanmar) was a once-in-a-lifetime experience for Lavinia, her brother John, her mother Selia and I.</p>

			        <p class="teaser_info"><p align="justify"><i>Of course, underneath the veneer of fresh-faced optimism that Obama is pushing -- note that the word "idealism" isn't appropriate here, because Obama isn't selling idealism so much as a kind of reinvigorated, feel-good pragmatism -- there operates a massive, well-oiled political machine no less ruthless and ambitious than that of his establishment rival, Hillary Clinton. Obama has raised $80 million, and it would be a grievous mistake to describe his candidacy as a grass-roots affair, particularly when he counts among his bundlers many of the lobbyists and political-finance pros who buttress the Clinton run.</i></p>


<p>&lt;!--break--><i><br />
<p align="justify">Even a cursory glance at Obama's money men is enough to confirm that fact. The list includes Wall Street hotshots from Lehman Brothers, Oppenheimer and Co., and Citigroup, a smattering of Hollywood players and Native American casino interests, representatives of big pharmaceuticals and the insurance sector -- in short, all the major food groups of reviled corporate influence-hunters.</p>
<p align="justify">
Worse still, Obama's financial backing is reflected in some of his Senate votes and campaign positions, including most notably his support for expanding NAFTA to Peru, limiting the ability of injured workers and consumers to sue for damages, and pouring federal funds into E85 corn-based ethanol, an alternative fuel for which the market is dominated by the Illinois-based Archer Daniels Midland Company. More than once I heard Obama give stirring speeches, only to mar them with plugs for ethanol. </p></i></p>

<p align="justify">
Just for the record, I am not badmouthing Obama - Hilary, I think, would be MUCH WORSE as a president. But seriously, why can't we talk about Kucinich? He's the only real choice. Barack is a self-proclaimed Centrist. He's in bed with big money. He doesn't have a progressive bone in his body. The best case scenario for Barack is that he indirectly <i>enables</i> progressive change. I literally heard this from a NPR pundit. At this point in our national suicide, are we really looking for <i>a chance</i> at 'indirect' progressivism? Can a guy like Barack really take the Fizers and Wellpoints of the world to task? I don't think so. He is no FDR. He is barely to the left of Reagan - he's just not a sociopath (like Shrubby is). Is that really how far the bar has dropped?<br /><br />
Meanwhile, read this about Kucinich and his career as Mayor of Cleveland:</p>


<p align="justify">
<i>He was elected mayor of Cleveland in 1977 on the promise to save the city's municipally-owned electric system which offered customers significantly lower rates than the private utility.   A year later, Cleveland's banks demanded that he sell the city's 70 year-old municipally-owned electric system to its private competitor (in which the banks had a financial interest) as a precondition of extending credit to the city.</i></p>


<p align="justify">
The attempted political blackmail failed as did several assassination attempts.  He remembered his parents counting out coins on the dresser and refused to sell the people's power.  In an incident unprecedented in modern American politics, the Cleveland banks plunged the city into default for a mere $15 million despite being offered triple collateral to protect the loan.</p>


<p align="justify">
The principled stand destroyed his political career.   He lost his reelection bid.  He was demonized as the mayor who threw Cleveland into default.  Fifteen years later, the citizens of Cleveland - recognizing  he had saved them hundreds of millions of dollars in municipal power bills and also forced the private utility to keep bills low to compete - voted him into the Ohio Senate.   His campaign signs featured  a light bulb and the expression "Because he was right.”  In 1998 the Cleveland City Council honored Dennis for "..having the courage and foresight to refuse to sell the city's municipal electric system.” </p>


<p>That's who we need in the White House.</p>

			        <p class="teaser_info"><p>...of the widespread voting irregularities that have become the sad, twilight-zone 'norm', I have a quote for you. This was taken from my favorite blogging site, <a href="http://smirkingchimp.com">SmirkingChimp.com</a> -<br />
<i><br />
The final official tally for Bush---less than 119,000 votes out of 5.4 million cast---varied by 6.7% from exit poll results, which showed a Kerry victory. Exit polls in 2004 were designed to have a margin of error of about 1%.</i></p>


<p>In various polling stations in Democrat-rich inner city precincts in Youngstown and Columbus, voters who pushed touch screens for Kerry saw Bush's name light up. A wide range of discrepancies on both electronic and paper balloting systems leaned almost uniformly toward the Bush camp. Voting procedures regularly broke down in inner city and campus areas known to be heavily Democratic.</p>


<p>In direct violation of standing federal election law, 56 of Ohio's 88 counties have since destroyed all or part of their 2004 election data. The materials were additionally protected by a federal court injunction in the King-Lincoln-Bronzeville federal civil rights lawsuit (in which we are attorney and plaintiff). To date, no state or federal prosecutions have resulted from this wholesale destruction of presidential election records, including 1.6 million ballots, cast and uncast, needed for definitive auditing procedures. However, two Cuyahoga County (Cleveland) election officials have been convicted of felony manipulation of an official recount. The Cleveland Plain-Dealer, the state's largest newspaper, recently editorialized that there is "no evidence" the 2004 election was stolen, but omitted mention of the destruction of the electoral records by more than half the counties in the state. The Plain-Dealer and other mainstream media have consistently ignored findings by the Free Press and others indicating widespread manipulation and theft of the kind Brunner has now confirmed was eminently do-able within the Ohio system.</p>

<p>Missouri is a beautiful place.<br /><br />
Wisconsin and Minnesota aren't so bad either.<br />
I just got back to Los Angeles, so it might take me a while to put up some more shots but they'll be up by the end of the week. We also got some video from a few of the shows. The tour was a total success. Special thanks to:</p>


<p><b>Nate</b> for hooking it up in Madison<br />
<b>Nick</b> for setting up the <b>New Earth</b> show<br />
<b>Christopher</b> at the Weary Traveller</p>


<p>We sold cds, we spread the word, and we realized that I should probably do my version of <i>Hallelujah</i> at every show. Good to know. :)<br />

I love being on the road. Songs write themselves when you are traveling. September is my favorite month to see the country.<br /><br />
I haven't played a show in Madison since I left in 1999. This is also a first time having a partner in crime on the road with me (Lavinia is coming along). We are going to have a great time.<br /><br />
I'll try to post updates from the road.<br /><br />
See you in the heartland!<br /><br />

We came and went like an afternoon tempest except we left a few cds behind and I kissed someone on the cheek. Ordering a drink from that bar somehow reminds me of leaning up against the Formosa cafe dressed the 50's detective and lighting a match off my shoe. Champagne, and coffee for the horses.<br /><br />
Let us all become lost for a short time together, and awaken to the future that invades us.<br /><br /></p>

<br />


<p>I played a few songs along with some other guests, most notably my good friend and killer songwriter Jay Sousa from 50 Cent Haircut. I sit in with his band on keys whenever I can. The night was very cool. Being back at O'Briens will always remind me of my Paper Sun days.</p>

<strong>New Shows<br /></p>

<p>11.19.06</strong><br /></p>

<br />


<p>I'll be in San Fran this weekend for a show, I'm looking forward to that. <b>Arms Around the River</b> will be mastered on Dec. 7th
 and then I'll send it out to be pressed - the cd release party will be at the <b>Hotel Cafe</b> in Hollywood early next year.</p>

<br />


<p>These are some of my best songs yet - Marc Moreau did the mixing, along with my friend Brandon Krueger who mixed a few tracks and Cythia Catania who had a hand in it as well.</p>

<br />


<p>This will be the third album I've produced and I am really getting the hang of it.</p>

<br />


<p>For the record, the songs that I have had playing from my site for the last few months are not the songs that will be featured on the album - I have some outtakes, some
really esoteric Krister Axel songs, and some live stuff available here on the website that WILL NOT be featured on the next album (not all of it, at least). I'm sorry if I did not make that clear early on.</p>

<br />


<p>I guess maybe there really is a market for the Krister Axel version of <b>Georgia On My Mind</b>.<br /><br />
I suppose I'll have to put out a cover album <i>a la</i> <b>Perfect Day</b> by Chris Whitley. That'll be my next project.<br /><br /></p>

<strong>The Freeze<br />
09.11.06</strong><br /><br /></p>

<p><small>I found this in an old notebook, dated 05.17.1997 (written in Madison, WI).</small><br /><br />
just this little stash of survival</p>

<br />never had a moment to think


<br />radio voices sound like someone I know


<br />moonlight makes me want to have a drink


<br />I listen to the rhythm of the traffic


<br />hiding in the silence I project


<br />push me through the womb of the future


<br />bear me as an infant to protect


<br />an island on the ocean planet 'solo'


<br />wailing of the unborn tragedy


<br />wiping from my eyes the mess of martyrs


<br />the burden of my passage through the freeze


<br />

For the record, I never cancel a show. I have to go back to March 10th, 1995, for the last show cancellation that
I was ever party to. Over ten years ago - at <b>The Chamber</b>, Madison, WI (no longer there). Good times.<br /><br />
Anyway, the reason was that I had an invitation to the Playboy Mansion that I couldn't refuse. So thank you all for being so understanding.</p>

<p>This is Hef's pet Toucan. He's got monkeys, rabbits, birds. It is literally a zoo. A really little one. I didn't like it at all. Very natural
looking, except of course for all the cages.<br /><br />
I hate to be judgemental, and I am not intimate with the details, but it does seem to me that if people like Hef each gave a small
but significant push for progressive politics instead of stuffing Toucans into cages, we might not be in quite the mess that we are now.
Anyway, thanks for the invite buddy. <br /><br />
So that's it and here I am - signing off from Hef's mini-zoo, where the playmates still wear the same outfits, but now in modern pastels.</p>

<strong>Sunset Boulevard<br /></p>

<p>08.15.06</strong><br /><br />
I work on Sunset now<br />
where dreams die and take shape<br />
where highways are twisted at the throat<br />
of the green that once was<br />
sometimes with more choice<br />
comes less freedom<br />
more sugar in place of food<br />
sirens for a handshake<br /></p>

<p>bright lights casting longer<br />
and longer shadows<br />
soon the earth will erupt<br />
and reshape the landscapes<br />
in her likeness<br />
to invade the invaders<br />
with mountains for fingers<br />
she brushes the cities<br />
from her brow. As if<br /></p>

<p>to invent a simple fabric<br />
between God and Man<br />
she turns over<br />
her bed<br /></p>

<strong>Jamaica<br />
08.07.06</strong><br /></p>

<br /> <font color="#666666"><small><i>August fights with bold teeth




<br />the rumor of a cold winter</i></font></small>


<br /><br />I don't know why I said that. It never gets cold in Los Angeles.


<br /><br />I was in Jamaica not much more than a month ago. It feels like much longer than that - it is amazing how long you can put things off for.


<p>We were there for the 4th of July and it was in full bloom, the sun was hot and the breeze was cold. The streets in the big cities were mostly
all right and the highway to Negril was almost new, but everywhere else there are holes in the street like missing teeth.
The land is so rich and green but the people are very poor. Buildings everywhere along the smaller highways stand in a half-constructed ethereal realm.
The whole western island seems to be in perpetual work-in-progress mode where the bags of gravel lay untended and the doors are all open as if the notice
came suddenly that there was no reason to work anymore.<br /><br />
We had a great time and Jamaica is a gorgeous country but it is a bit unsettling to know how much power money has been given in our society.<br />
Lavinia and I rented a car in Montego Bay and drove all the way to Treasure Beach. It was such a long drive that we decided to
split it up on the way back and stay in Negril for the night en route.</p>

<p>This is Lavinia, in all her hotness. There is not much more to say about this picture, she is the love of my life and it is also quite obvious that she is the sexiest woman that has ever lived. Here she is just outside <b>Jack Sprat's</b>. The water was very blue at that beach.
That was a good day.</p>

<br /><br />I brought my <i>Martin</i> and played it a lot. Lazy days.

<p>I got to play some music, I played a few songs during the set break one night at the hotel. It was totally unplanned and was a real highlight for me.
I met a jamaican musician named Toby One and we became friends. Cool man. His friend Wendell played tambourine and held the mic stand.</p>

<br />


<p>People all over the world are amazingly gracious and giving. Everyone we met was essentially kind. It is just a shame that such a beautiful
place can be in effect annexed by big-business tourism without the people of Jamaica ending up with much of anything at all.</p>

<p>We did a show together last week at <strong>The Stone</strong> and it was very cool. <i>Summer Drug</i> was the first song I played and the one Kim liked the best. As it turns out we are both mad for <a href="http://www.chriswhitley.com/" target="_blank">Chris Whitley</a>.

<p>Kim tells me there is a video rental shop in Melbourne where she grew up that is constantly playing <strong>Loco Girl</strong> and other songs off of <strong>Dirt Floor</strong> for the customers, and if you can guess the name of the song they will give you a free rental. If only I lived next to a place like that where they serve drinks.</p>

<p><i>Peace for the winter I pray for you</p>

to change your mind<br />
I'm learning how to turn back time<br />
I'll say good night but I don't mean mine<br />
You're a summer drug</p>

<br />I guess that's good enough<br /><br />


<p>You're still blind from the summer flame</p>

<br />


<p>love-drunk and whisky-tame</p>

<br />


<p>on that old yesterday</p>

<br />


<p>you wake up and see the sky</p>

<br />


<p>you got no good reasons why<br />
you're not just wasting time<br /><br />
I've been waiting for you<br />
to change your mind...<br />

<p>Everyone is confirmed for <strong><i>Roots Rock for Lovers</i></strong>.</p>

<br />


<p>I have always wanted to play a show at <strong>the Stone</strong>. It is right in Hollywood and I know the lights
will be shining on us in the hip dive room of our time. Hollywood is the new West Hollywood which puts Koreatown in
as the next Hollywood.<br />
Anyway <strong>Sally Jaye</strong> is a total heartbreaker, <strong>Shawn Pander</strong> is like molasses on
broken glass and <strong>Brandon Krandon</strong> will make you believe. We got everything
from a diddled-eyed Joe to a damned if I know.</p>

<br />I'm glad you'll be going. They serve 4 kinds of whisky and I plan to try every one.


<br />


<br />Get there early, stay late and drink just like it's Saturday.


<br />I will be playing acoustic guitar for the first time in a while, and if the wind blows right I may get my

<p><strong>06.22.06</strong><br /><br />
I was talking to a friend of mine last week, and he asked me what I've been up to.<br />
I replied that I was adding some informative current events
links to my home page in such a way that I can update and append to them often and easily.
His reply was: <i>what are you doing that for</i>?<br /><br /></p>

<ul>
<li>which I thought was sort of odd. We are literally exploding the federal deficit, funneling hundreds of billions
of taxpayer dollars every year into wrong-headed priorities for a clumsy military. International diplomacy is at an all-time low
and the value of the dollar is eroding but you wouldn't know it by watching TV or reading any of the major newspapers. <br />
Not to mention the completely overt lawlessness of a power-drunk and peerlessly incompetent administration.<br />
Yet, there is no perceived need for unbiased information.<br />
That's a lot of kool-aid.</li>
</ul>

<p>Coronado is very cool. Many thanks to Nancy Peace for hooking us up with a great gig.<br /><br />
Tomorrow the band is tracking with an A-list engineer in a badass recording studio and I am really looking forward to it.<br /><br />
I'll keep you posted.</p>

<p><strong>05.15.06</strong><br /><br /></p>

<br />Yesterday was my birthday.


<br />




<br />Life is really good these days. My new album <strong>iMTHEGUN</strong> is coming along nicely. 


<p>I have a recording session coming up at <a href="http://www.newmonkeystudio.com/" target="_blank">NEW MONKEY STUDIOS</a>,
which some of us will remember as the studio that was
a labor of love for <strong>Elliot Smith</strong>, that tragic and beautiful poet.</p>

<br /><br />


<p>It will be a very deep experience to explore my own creativity as a songwriter and composer on his beloved keyboards. I have
always found that every instrument has its own voice and personality, and this is even more true for vintage keyboards like antique pianos
 from 1917 and a 50's-era harmonium. Sigh.
 <br /> <br />
 Every time I meet a new piano, a song is written. This has never failed me.<br />
 The best part is that I am finally doing a recording to tape in a place where I know the air will be full
 of muses and electricity and above all, microphones.
 <br /><br /></p>

<p>I won't be gigging very much this summer, but if you live near San Diego you can catch a show with the full band
on <strong>Coronado Island</strong>.<br />
It's an outdoor Cancer Benefit called <strong>RELAY FOR LIFE</strong> on SAT JUNE 10th.<br /><br />
Yes, I'm having two birthday parties;<br />
and yes, I quit the <strong>Cheyenne Kimball</strong> band, for reasons that shall remain private - I will say only that we parted on good terms and I wish her nothing but the best. <br>
I think on the <strong>MHD Network</strong> they are still airing a live show that I did with her in Breckinridge this past January.</p>

<br />Highlights:


<p><li>Witnessing a true legend perform, Ian McLagan.</li>
<li>Jamming with John Popper. He literally walked in off the street while I was playing a song, and stepped up to the mic with his harmonica. It was gorgeous.</li>
<li>Singing <i>We'll Sweep Out The Ashes In the Morning</i> with <a href="http://www.naimee.cjb.net/" target="_blank">Naimee Coleman</a> at the Gram Parsons tribute.</li></p>

<li>Playing two-on-a-keyboard with Jenni Alpert while Tom Freund sang <i>You Ain't Going Nowhere</i>. </li></p>

The amazing line-up musicians that I will be performing with includes members of Wilco, The Minus 5, and REM. This whole weekend in Austin is going to be completely surreal.</li></p>

<pre><code>    I've been playing keys lately with Sony/Epic artist Cheyenne Kimball and it's pretty awesome. In the past month I've met some very cool people from both Sony and MTV. Cheyenne's new show on MTV will be airing early this summer, called &lt;strong&gt;Cheyenne 15&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;
  Yup, she's 15 and she rocks.   &lt;br /&gt;
  So while I'm writing more songs for my next album I'll be on the road with Cheyenne. Here are some photos from our show at the Breckenridge Riverwalk Center for the MHD Network&lt;strong&gt; Music with Altitude&lt;/strong&gt; Concert Series. It was about 10 degrees Fahrenheit but who cares - this is rock and roll, baby.&lt;br /&gt;

<p>      This was a first for me, everywhere we went there were cameras. It's fun for about 45 seconds and then it gets annoying. Poor Cheyenne didn't have a moment's peace.

<p>09.15.05</p>

<p>  In September I see boots before
  the first rain, vast migrant flocks
  flying before the last late sunset
  threatens: a strange, nervous pox
  which might never find a certain cure
  where the stricken fly in nervous flocks</p>

<p>  In September I can't focus, I
  am estranged, staring out
  at the passional leaves so proud
  to be falling so many
  dreams happily dying and by
  each day these old colors flushing out.</p>

<p>  Is that not the way, in September
  of all things answering to
  love? To be sudden, elegant
  and trampled like the fallen truth
  in September when time is so fast
  and every moment is the last</p>

<p>  moment of summer<br></p>

<p>
The last days of summer in Los Angeles. It's been good to be back. <br>
I have two songs that just made it on a to an Indie movie directed by my friend Ryan Byrne, details to follow.<br>

<p>07.14.05 London Tragedy = Hope<br><p>

<p>  <br>
  London is just a gorgeous city, plain and simple. This is a fact. <br>
  <br>
Being a lover of distant places, my whole experience there was sort of bittersweet because of course it wasn't about me at all. The day after I got there, some bombs went off on the Underground and on a bus, and the whole city went into a state of shock. There was no way to get around the city, all the means of transportation had been shut down, and the show that I had come to do was cancelled because there would have been no one there. Suddenly, my whole agenda as a performer and a songwriter was made to seem very petty, and I was glad to be alive. I wrote a lot of lyrics, and spent some time exploring what is important to me. This ancient, vibrant, aesthetic masterpiece of a city was wounded and I could do nothing. I don't know what I expected to happen, but in the end what I remember is the kindness of everyone I met.</p></p>

<p> I'm thinking of the city
  with its arms around the river
  with no end and no beginning

  like a chain of stars
  It's trying to tell me something
  about the light between two lovers
  the light that's on your face
all you have to do
shine on for me
  if you can't afford to sleep

  I'll be the push that brings you back
  it's Saturday
  and there's something in the air
  I don't believe that we are lost
I don't believe that we are lost</p>


<p>And I took a lot of pictures. That first day of the tragedy when the streets were swollen with sad faces and the sun came out in the afternoon I was mesmerized, taking pictures of all the beauty I could fit onto a camera lense. The flowers, the facades, the trees, the monuments - cathedrals tucked away like toy houses, and everywhere the proud and worn face of centuries. I am completely in love with this city.</p>

<p>06.13.05 NXNE in Toronto and the House of Blues<br></p>

<p>It was another one of those weekends. It went by in a flash of lights and humidity, the first Spring weather in Toronto and everyone was out in the streets. A beautiful city, alive in ways that we don't see in LA. The streets are packed and there are trams and cobblestones and the whole place has that lived-in feeling like a pair of jeans or an old fireplace.</p>


<table style="width:auto;"><tr><td><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/mN-b5rxUc94YZKmIhmplDzOVRZNSpnbS6833kNhGsxs?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_aJ4urxfgN9A/TSulyKe9LOI/AAAAAAAAFaI/R6K_wh-wbTI/s400/SUC50026.JPG" height="300" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td style="font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:11px; text-align:right">From <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/krister.axel/TorontoNXNE2005?authkey=Gv1sRgCP_7xprJqP68nAE&feat=embedwebsite">Toronto NXNE 2005</a></td></tr></table>

<p>We flew in on Friday, practiced Saturday afternoon and performed that night. It was truly inspiring the way we were received. the Canadians we met were all really cool and it was great to have so many people tell us that they really connected with the music. We laughed a lot this weekend. We made many new friends.</p>

<p>Toronto has a pretty unique sense of humor, almost everyone we met had us cracking up. I made some good contacts and I hope to get back over there soon. Coming back was sort of intense because my flight into LAX was delayed and I made it to the House of Blues for my show just a few minutes before Matty D, Mike Forrester and Mike Freas were going to figure out something to play without me. </p>


<p>It felt really good to park the car, walk right up and hit a nice 30 minute set. A good crowd, and I always love playing in the Foundation Room. I saw my friend Curtis Peoples who was there with Josh Kelly in the main room, Keaton Simons was on the bill and we traded cds. I love <a href="http://www.canofjam.com/" target="_top">Can of Jam</a> events, there's always a family vibe. See you at the beach in Hermosa! </p>

Everyone was there.<br>
It was like a family reunion. The energy of the crowd was electric and 
everyone was singing along to the point where I thought I was hearing voices.<br>
Check out this version on my new song I'm the Gun - this is where we had people screaming so loud they got picked
up in the mix from the onstage microphones that were facing the other way...<BR>

For those of you that aren't musicians, it is rare that you actually hear the crowd in a live recording unless you specifically put a microphone out in the crowd. In this case, everyone was so loud that that it didn't matter where the microphone was. :)
<BR>
<BR>
It was an honor to share the stage with Sally Jaye, Kyler England, LOONER and Jay Nash.<br>
A special thanks to all the guys in my band:<br>

Matt Delvecchio - bass, vocals
Mike Forrester - drums
Mike Freas - guitar
The Mighty Chet Dixon - harmonica, vocals
Curtis Byrd - drums<br>

<p>The <a href="http://www.stelmovillage.org/" target="_top">St. Elmos Village</a> / OG3 Records / Simply Songwriting Music Award. A show, a paperweight, and a cash prize. It was a great success, I felt really good about my set and the place was sort of magic. It was really warm,  not just the sunshine but the people. Everyone should know about this place, it's a center for creativity and positivity and they gave me this honor. </p>




<p>The whole weekend was a hit, from the 2 sets at the Lighthouse in Hermosa Beach to Sunday morning in San Diego and the afternoon in Los Angeles. The cds are selling. I love it. The guys in the band are so cool, we're just having a good time and working it out. We have a sweet sound, with Chet on harmonica singing harmonies with Matty D on bass and Mike Freas on guitar. Forrester was on vacation this weekend. Curtis Byrd played drums with us at the Lighthouse. Yeah.<br>

  It was good to be on the road with my friends Zoe and Angel, and their little dog Ruby. We drove probably 5000 miles in 10 days. I sold a surprising amount of t-shirts and had a lot of fun playing solo, especially at this record store on Fayetteville called Sound Warehouse, I just brought my guitar and played on a bar stool in the middle of the store. That's what songwriting is all about, I felt like I was selling apples at a fruit stand. I walked into that place and the first thing he said was 'I have some vodka' so I could tell he was a friendly guy. He mixed me up a stoli and pop and I got to feeling pretty comfortable. A piano would have been way too loud for that little place so the guitar was perfect. Nice and simple. </p>
<p>This is the golf course we got to have our way with because our friend  works there. Arkansas is beautiful. We had it all to ourselves because it was closed that day. We drove around in golf carts drinking beer.</p>

<p>I've got the Permanent Friday Night release scheduled for June 2nd at the Hotel Cafe, and I'll be getting back out on the road again pretty soon. Next weekend I'm in Hermosa Beach, and then San Diego in the morning and Los Angeles in the afternoon... I will be accepting a songwriting award for my song Ordinary. In a few more weeks, I'll be in Toronto, showcasing at the North by Northeast Music Festival.</p>

04.10.05 The Knitting Factory
<p class="style1">It's just a great stage, it reminds me of !st Ave in Minneapolis, the second tier with black steel handrails and very sparse lighting. Mysterious.</p>
<p class="style1">I didn't know we were playing in the main room until just before we started, and it felt great to have such sweet sound. We had space, we had eyes, we had sound. We had a reason.<br>
  The album goes out for printing on Monday, and I've got some amazing musicians on stage with me at my shows now. I started out playing solo at Highland Grounds and now I'm playing my songs with a 6-piece band at the Knitting Factory. I am blessed. <br>
  The Spring tour is booked except for a few dates, I'll be all over the US, mostly the Southeast and the West Coast. Some solo shows, some stripped-down band stuff. We'll just have to wait and see. The right things always happen at the right times.</p>
<p class="style1">This piece of verse is featured in the layout of Permanent Friday Night, which is taken from a poem I wrote to a friend of mine about two years ago. I spent a lot of time with with my good friend Timothy Norris working on the layout for this album, and I had a whole biography I wanted to put on the panel that I'm using for this poem. You know, 'I first had an idea for this album bla bla bla...' but I figured I'd spare y'all the details and get down to what I really mean.</p>
<p>be glad for that precious pain
there is poetry under your skin;

you are aware
of the human tragedy - that we fall
madly through time
towards death
and truth
in the span of 30,000 sunsets
with only love to guide us

  <br>
  All right. This was pretty serious. Background: 2 years ago I became very good friends with Sally and Joel from Paper Sun. I played with them in their band for about a year, and it was an amazing time. We sang some of the tightest 4-part harmonies you'll ever hear.</p>
<p class="style1">Fast forward to present time - we have continued to develop separate projects, and this was our first time on a bill together in some time. Some of my regular band members were out in Austin this past weekend, so I had to scrounge up a line-up sort of last minute and it was entirely dope. Jeramy Gritter on guitar - holy shit. Jazz vibe, great ear, knows exactly what time it is. Adam Marcello - drums, this guy is a legend in the making. The Mighty Chet Dixon - harmonica, backup vocals - the voice of Louisiana. Mike Forrester, percussion (with the sweet touch). Marc Regan, standup bass like a truck full of molasses. I loved this show so much, I am posting the mp3s right here so that everyone can hear how cool it was.</p>
<p class="style1">We played 5 songs in 40 minutes. It was beautiful. There's something about freedom, within music especially, that just gains momentum so unpredictably. I felt that on Sunday, like some big iron pendulum swinging across the bar, across this lobby of a forgotten hotel. I was among my own, these are the people I love. Jeramy said it himself, &quot;this is what happens when we get together.'</p>
<p class="style1">You see that? At 6pm on Sunday, I didn't even know who was playing. At 9pm, we had just finished our set. It was   a gift. </p>

<p class="style1">It was cold and full of taxis and after the show at Opaline we walked down the street to the Avenue A bar and drank too much whiskey the way you do when you know that someone else is driving... and your girl climbs onto your lap in the back of the cab on the way back to the hotel's 19th floor and you think to yourself, this is better than the movies... and then 3am finds you staring at the Queensboro bridge like a big truck outside the window - <br>
and as long as my heart still beats I am alive in these places, where the sun never shines through completely and the shadows look like nothing next to the dark heart of the city.<br>
You can wake up and be at the airport in an hour, waving a cup of coffee at the navy-blue shoes on the tarmac and get off in Oakland next to Laura Dern.</p>
<p class="style1">I sang for the  airport traffic, sang for the sky-caps and Laura Dern who wouldn't look at me but my ride came first so I never saw her face and it was a hot one that  Sunday in March with the taste of a New York latte still in my mouth... and the Hotel Utah, my sister's proud face and my old friends Carl and Chad... My rocker friends from Los Angeles (Janet Robin, Jen Alpert, Saucy Monky) shared the stage with me and it was a home away from home. My  friend Jenni took care of us in her house by the ocean and we felt loved. Two down.</p>
<p class="style1">We drove home in the mini-van, with breakfast bagel sandwiches and award-winning Russian coffee from a guy named Doug with a shop near Golden Gate park. Los Angeles was waiting for us like a spider's web where we drove around in circles dropping off guitars and we got stuck right in the middle, by the time I got home I had just enough time to get to Room 5 for my show with Chris Pierce and Joe Purdy and Gabriel Mann. Three down.</p>
<p class="style1">Two days later, we are out in Santa Monica where we can smell the ocean and it's a beautiful night, a woman buys me a drink before she even hears me play and we sound better than maybe ever... And the song I had written 4 hours before the gig was the best thing we played that night and it occurs to me that I love my Wurlitzer exactly where it is, waiting for me when I get home... and my voice sounds like honey and razor blades and I can't stop singing my own song back to myself before I go to sleep. </p>

<p class="style1">The Viper Room was pretty heavy. Lots of twisting and dancing and artificial smoke. It was as an occasion, to look out at the faces and know the best is yet to come. It rained like it was the end of the world that night, and you still couldn't see through the thick of it.Well done. </p>

<p class="style1">I am booking some great shows for this Spring. The future is bright. </p>
<p class="style1"><hr>
<span class="style1">02.19.05 </span>
<p class="style1">Only a few more weeks and I'll have the album done. I can't even believe it.
</p>
<p class="style1">It has been, no joke, almost 2 years since I started this thing. I can't possibly say how happy it makes me to have this album almost finished.</p>
<p class="style1">Matt Delvecchio has been an amazing help.</p>
<p class="style1">All the other guys in my band - Bart Ryan, Chet Dixon, Mike Forrester, Mike Freas, you guys rock. Stsy tuned for more news as it comes in. Right now, I've got the Viper Room to look forward to and in two more weeks I'll be in New York City!</p>

I always made mistakes<br />
Forgive me. Truth be told<br />
I have been weak for some time<br />
But you know this. We believed each other<br />
And it was beautiful<br />
Until the weight of my own darkness<br />

When you come<br />
I wish a thousand blessings on you<br />
For not hesitating<br />

All I have to offer<br />
Are the moments not<br />
Forgotten. I am empty<br />
As I was. Drowning<br />
like a dumb puppy. </p>


<p>I don't know how to be touched</p>


<p>Forgive me.</p>




<blockquote><small>The previous was an apology to a girlfriend who deserved better.

Next is her exceptional reply:</small></blockquote>


<p>Temporary</p>

<p>So he said he runs away even from the good things
Well now, I run full force ahead into them
Knocking them down with my brashness
When they eventually recover from their temporary
concussions
They look at me and say- who are you? and how did
you get here?</p>

<p>I think you will say that eventually
I came at you like a man
But now I want to be a girl
She said you have to stay the same
I can't change
Oh horrid consistency</p>

<p>You are a good thing, I think
But I don't know if I am blinded by your chords
Or that feeling of wanting to covet or possess the
truth you harmonize
Do I just want a piece? Do I just want to be
inspired?
To be in the presence of a force
To know that for a moment when the lights are low
and the flame burns
high
That you are mine-to touch, to breathe in, to hold
Briefly</p>

<p>In a city of the lost and found
I smiled
And you smiled back
For a time I found you
But in the pit of my stomach I have the creeping
sensation of loss
The echo chamber, the tug on the sleeve, the tap on
the shoulder
I can't hit snooze</p>

<p>So I will tell you about myself
I will make the fatal error of maxim exposure
I will smile and bat my eyes and
Hope that you don't make me sorry</p>

<p>awwhh, you know
you're making me blush...
no really, I have not gotten lucky in a little too long.
I'm sore from 35 minutes of aerobic kickboxing and a whole lot of
stretching.
Anyway, tonight should be easier.
I'll keep you posted...</p>

<p>the milk story: (I'll try to make this quick)</p>

<p>when I moved back to Paris at the age of 11, I still had a bunch of
friends in NY.
So the first summer I was back - by then I guess I was twelve  - I had a
friend come to visit.
His name was Dennis.
We all went to a town called Cavalier, which is kind of in between Nice
and Monte Carlo in the south of France.
Some family friends had time-shared a beautiful mansion - no joke, like 10
bedrooms - right on some cliffs by the coast.
Very cool.
So it was my then-still-intact family, my friend Dennis, this other
family, and some of their friends.
One night after hanging out all day at our private beach, we all had
dinner together.
Dennis and I had some red wine with dinner - I was only 12, but I could
handle it.
Dennis, on the other hand, couldn't. He was feeling sick.
My sister Katia, who had a nice buzz on, decided that the best thing to do
would be for all of us to learn the words to her favorite Doug E Fresh
song, you know, Ladi Dadi, we like to party - I think that's how it goes -
so we could all sing it together.
Anyway, that worked for a while - but it was getting late, and we were
going to bed, and Dennis was still feeling sick.</p>

<p>So my mother, in her infinite wisdom, decided to warm up some milk, for
him to drink, thinking that would help him sleep.
He took a sip - and you could already tell that it was the worst possible
thing for him to be putting in his body, just by his facial expression -
but my mother didn't see that, she was just smiling at him, waiting for
him to finish it.
So Dennis, being the pushover that he was, just drank the rest of it in
one gulp. My mother was satisfied with that, and kissed us all goodnight.
The minute the door had closed, Dennis went running for the bathroom, and
spent the next ten minutes reliving his dinner experience - with me and my
sister singing Doug E Fresh. Ladi Dadi, we like to party, we don't cause
trouble we don't, bother nobody...</p>

<p>And about a half hour later, we were all asleep, even Dennis. So maybe it
worked, after all.</p>

<p>That's the milk story.</p>

<p>how are you feeling, lush?</p></blockquote>

<p>there once was a girl
who never asked for what she wanted
so she never quite knew
there were good things and bad things
always there were gifts and people who adored her
but nothing ever made her completely happy.
So she said to herself:</p>

<pre><code>Maybe if I can make everyone in the world love me
maybe that will make me happy
to know that no one ever thinks badly of me
</code></pre>

<p>so she tried really hard, to always say the nicest things
and to always listen, and to go wherever she needed to
and always smile at people and to always seem happy, at least</p>

<p>but there were always people she hadn't met
that looked at her, suspiciously
and she was convinced they were thinking bad thoughts about her
and it only made her feel worse
so she said to herself:</p>

<pre><code>Maybe if I keep moving around, I will find the perfect place
and everything will be right
and I will know where it is that I was meant to stay
</code></pre>

<p>so she travelled, and spent lots of money
she saw Rome and Cairo and Bangkok and Rio
and everywhere in between
and she had fun, she stayed busy
but one day, she woke up in a hotel
and felt something was missing
there was an emptiness about her
and she realized that she missed her home
but she didn't know where that was anymore</p>

<p>So she said to herself:</p>

<pre><code>Maybe if I don't listen to anyone
and always do what I want without thinking
and be completely selfish
maybe that will make me happy
</code></pre>

<p>so she never thought about anyone
and always pushed her way to the front of the line
and took the best seats
and double-parked, and never shared with anyone
but she realized she was lonely, and that wasn't working either.</p>

<p>So, she was finally in very much despair
she had tried everything
and still wasn't happy
so she asked her friend emma what to do</p>

<p>and emma said - I know just the thing
you should have sex with my friend krister
he'll cheer you right up</p>

<p>so that's what she did
and she never stopped smiling</p>

<p>:)</p>

<p>A lot to say.</p>

<p>Annemarieke argued herself out of a relationship with me. The first weekend, we went to the Pier View with her dog, walked on the beach, saw dolphins. Very nice. I slept over, had unprotected sex, very much not like me. She is a good girl, and should not be any danger. The next weekend, we saw a couple of movies - Meet The Family, she liked that one. Ladies Man, eh, not so bad. At the last show she came to - Viper Room #3 - apparently she didn't like that I left her alone for 10 minutes so I could mingle. Can you say, high maintenance? Sorry babe.
So it all came down to this past Sunday. We got back from Ladies man, I needed to grab some clothes so I could sleep over and make it to work in the morning. Next thing you know, she's asking me to twist one - and then another (this coming from young Miss DARE Amsterdam). She had something to get off of her chest. She asked me directly - what do you do, in a relationship, when you know you won't get what you want? My answer, I knew why she was asking already - was, you move on. Just that simple. So maybe I decided for her.
Anyway, the next day David can't get her out of his house. She cried on her dog pillow, as I was leaving, and apparently wished that I had turned around and knocked. What a wimp. You make strong move, you can't be looking for anyone to hold your hand. I respected her for being so all business. Oh well.
And then there is Emma. She should be a chapter herself. A novel. I guess it boils down to this - anyone who offers their butt so willingly, so confidently - 9 times out of 10 I won't be worried about protection. Which is ridiculous, because that's when you are in such danger. But again, with Emma, I don't know how much she hasn't told me but I have a gut feeling that there is nothing to worry about. She said she always has a boyfriend, and I think the guys she ends up with are probably pretty wholesome types.
Shit, I don't know. That's the end of it. That won't happen again with anyone else. I promise to myself, to god, and anyone who is listening. I cannot jeopardize my future like that. It really is Russian roulette.</p>

<p>So, I guess I have very little to worry about. Which is good, because that is still enough to keep me a little stressed, give me that edge. I think at one point, you have to trust your instincts, and your lack of them, and as well trust your mistakes. I stand by these last two weeks, and I hope deeply that I won't live to regret them at all because they have been very dear to me. I have, all at once, all the tools I have been looking for - income, relationships, a good gig, inspiration, personal freedom. Now I need to bend the road in front of me, paint myself a doorway out. These are my strengths.
I have so much to do, and I am happy to say that I am completely on track. 26 years old, finally making a decent income, a car on the way, debts receding, social and inter-sexual skills improving, confidence returning. I am no longer afraid to admit that I deserve all of this, I have brought love into the world and I have made unselfish sacrifices. I am a good person, the universe loves me and I love it right back.
My musical tastes are rounding another corner, I guess thanks to Revolver I am embracing the Brit Pop movement. Radiohead, Travis, Coldplay - I feel these now. Another notch.</p>

<p>Emma girl, Emma girl</p>

<p>I am safe with you
I am not broken
I will live as long as I wish
I have so far to go
I have barely begun</p>

<p>And that is why I am absolutely content. I love where I am, what I am doing. I am looking forward to seeing my friends in Madison, and seeing my friends in Chicago.</p>

<p>Amen</p>

<p>what do I say to all that? Aside from, you have a way with words. I can
tell
you and I are going to get along famously! Even if we don't have that
badda
bing badda bang that some people have... at least I know I am comfortable
enough to make a new friend in this crazy town... I am not worried about
the
three week thing...actually it's a subconscious effort... I can't help it,
it just happens that way. But, it's not important is it?! Not really...</p>

<ul>
<li>I just proof-read this next paragraph, and realize that my grammar
sucks,
my sentences are really long, and you can forget about good sentence
structure. So, rather than fix it... I decided to say fuck it, forgive the
butchering of the english language... read on!!
What do I like to do for fun? Hmmm... I love work... workaholic I
suppose!
But, for fun, I go out with my friends... dinner-mostly sushi in Hermosa
Beach, because that's where all those silly girls live!, drinks in
hermosa,
hollywood, westwood, brentwood... you name it! If it's fun, you can pretty
much bet we'll do it. I am not a real TV person, so I don't spend a ton of
time in front of one, but when I do watch, I am almost catatonic... it
sucks
me in! not that I enjoy it all that much! Um...I completely enjoy some
alone
time now and then. I like grabbing a good book, a pad of paper, my
favorite
pen of the week (I have a pen thing, if I find one I love, I won't let go
of
it! Sick, eh?!), my smokes and reading glasses and going to a coffee shop
to
just sit and ponder life, people, and what-not. My idea of a great day is
waking up to coffee and a smoke, showering, sitting around in my robe for
a
bit, then getting dressed going somewhere public and writing, then going
home having sex with George Cloony (just kidding!), taking another shower,
and going out with my friends for some drunk pleasurable partying (ie.
dancing and drinking). I have this thing about dancing though, I have to
be
drunk enough to get into it... and when I do it, it's with wreckless
abandon. So, that's me... I like reading, writing, talking, watching,
driving, drinking an orgasmic glass of wine, kissing, and looking up at
the
stars to make a wish everynight. What do I wish for? Depends on the
night...
mostly it's that everything will work out in my life... but I don't really
have to wish for that, even though it makes me feel better when I do.</li>
</ul>


<p>I love to travel, but I also realize that I can tell you all about this
stuff in person... it's good to save some things for later.</p>

<p>As for whatever it is you look like... you said to picture you as a young
child... well, that's a bit of a turn off...sorry to say! I just can't
seem
to get into the whole idea... I have a little brother so it's kinda making
me sick. So, here's the deal, I am sending you a picture of me from
August... I was in Hawaii, drinking a mai-tai and having a great time with
the family... you can tell by the look on my face. Call me crazy for
actually sending you a picture, but I figure it's a better way to know who
the hell you are telling your childhood stories to.</p>

<p>I'm leaving in about 45 minutes, please write back... or write my hotmail
account if it's later.... I want to hear what you have to say to all this
hooplah! And, please don't tell me I make you sick... that would really be
a
blow to my ego.</p>

<p>I guess I should explain a little...
at the risk of going a little too far in depth, picture me as a young
child...
I am the youngest of three, two older sisters.
My father is seventeen years older than my mother. Before I moved back to
Paris in 1985, we lived in White Plains, a relatively affluent suburb of
New
York City, in Westchester county. It wasn't quite Rochester, or New
Rochelle
- that was upper class - but we were like upper middle class... I guess
the
difference is, expensive domestics - Cadillacs - as opposed to BMWs, or
something.
In any case, we had a beautiful, enormous house. In 1982, for example, I
was
8 years old, and my mother was still in her 30s. I went to school just a
few
blocks away. Sometimes my mother would walk me to school. Other times, she
would pick me up for lunch. Those were good days. At the age of 37, my
mother was still completely stunning. I was finally thinning out a little,
but I was this chubby little dude with a whole mess of curly hair and a
big
smile. We drove a nice Volvo, lived in this great house, I was put into
this
advanced program in school - life was better than great. That, initially,
is
what life was to me. Everyone was beautiful, there were no problems with</p>

<h2>money or otherwise, living was just like marching in a parade or something</h2>

<p>I knew where I was going...
And then, we moved to Paris - the second time. Next thing you know, I'm
smoking hashish and cigarettes, drinking Johnny Walker - I got quite a
jumpstart - I started writing music on the piano. I was growing up.
And then, all of a sudden - my sisters both graduated, my parents
divorced,
I spent 6 months with my mother in Paris and then got shipped back to NY
to
finish High School.</p>

<p>I think it was around this time that started asking myself, what the hell
just happened? Where did all the beauty go?</p>

<p>And now, as an adult, I get the chance to see my mother once in a great
while. The last time she came to visit, this past September, we got to
talk
a lot. That may have been the first real peer-to-peer dialogue that we
have
ever had.
I'm trying to remember exactly who she was referring to... It may have
been
the guy that came to deliver the couch that she helped me buy from Ikea.
But she said, really casually - "not very attractive, is he?" - with a
little curl of the lips. Like he was doing her a disservice, or he was
directly insulting her with his looks.
And I felt this whole wave of resentment towards her. I still don't really
understand it.
I think I felt like it was a revelation, like all of a sudden I realized
that my mother was biased against ugly people.
But I am too - when I see someone who I find strikingly unattractive, I am
actually fascinated. And who am I to make judgements about the way some
people perceive and react to other people? Making judements about people
who
are judgemental is like the pot calling the kettle black. It doesn't make
any sense.</p>

<p>I don't even know why I'm telling you this, except to explain that if I am
touchy about being 'aesthetically judgemental', it's because I still don't
know why that little comment of my mother's bothered me so much. But I am
guilty also - it's human nature.
It's Darwinism, for crying out loud...
And I think it's a little bit of guilt, because all of my life I've known
that I'm pretty easy on the eyes. But if anything, physical beauty is a
curse, because it tricks you into believing it's actually worth something
by
itself - which it isn't...</p>

<p>Wow, I just got pretty deep.</p>

<p>Not bad for an explanation, though, eh?</p>

<p>And as for your three week test phase, I imagine the key is to not worry
about it (for me at least).</p>

<p>I totally agree, if it's not fun, it's not worth it.
So let's just have fun.</p>

<p>What do you like to do, aside from writing long emails? (which I'm getting
pretty good at, also)</p>

			        <p class="teaser_info"><p>Whatever</p>

<p>Maybe I should write another poem
Maybe I should drink some more poison
Maybe there's no difference between love and
frustration</p>

<p>Maybe I haven't wasted anything
It seems so sudden, this shift
This earthquake. But the sky was dark for months</p>

<p>And where do I find peace, now?
Which way to something better, forgiveness
I hate myself for being your victim</p>

<p>I still fantasize about your body but
Now I have nightmares about your friendship
About the words you never could say</p>

<p>If you love me, you still don't know why
And it doesn't make you happy
So why should it matter?</p>

<p>If I told you how many times I've said
To myself: "You aren't going to call her ever again,
unless..."
You wouldn't believe it</p>

<p>Unless this, or that - if you'd call by Friday
If you fucked me well, blew me whatever
Unless nothing is the logical end</p>

<p>I feel no more pain, I should thank you
For that but I won't
I've been numb for a month now</p>

<p>If I could have it all again
All the time I should have spent
Instead of wasting it on love</p>

<p>like I didn't have enough</p>

<p>I knew in San Francisco, you took your dog
And left me on the phone with Reception
"I will be alone tonight, in fact..."</p>

<p>I can't be let down anymore
I can't love you like this, anymore
You chose your path
I am choosing mine
I choose no more disappointment
A dusty road in August
Away from Ohio
Tell your mother you lost a friend
Somewhere in West Hollywood</p>

<p>Goodbye</p>

			        <p class="teaser_info"><p>This is the first poem I wrote that I am proud of. I was six years and eight months old. It primarily makes me think of two things. One is that I was clearly first a poet - it was my first natural form of expression, along with possibly art but that is so common for kids of that age that it does not seem noteworthy. The fact that I was writing poems at such an early age means that must be my true calling. I was writing poems as early as 1978, and by 1981 I had a certain facility with it. Of course, I was sort of lacking in big concepts but that's why I like this one - it has a remarkable sense of self-awareness and mortality, which is arguably the richest of deep concepts.</p>

<p>Here it is:</p>

<blockquote>When I was One,
I had just begun.
When I was two
I was nearly new.
When I was three
I was hardly me.
When I was Four,
I was not much more.
When I was Five,
I was just alive.
But now I am Six,
I'm as clever as clever
So I think I'll be six
now for ever and ever.</blockquote>

<p>Notice the slightly random sense of capitalization, I was still figuring out the rules. :)</p>

<blockquote>UPDATE: It has come to my attention that the above poem is identical to a poem called "Now We Are Six" by A.A. Milne, so I can't take credit for that one. I'm not sure why I would have copied a poem like that but I am assuming that was actually the assignment, to just copy something. Maybe it was a handwriting challenge. Anyway, that explains why I only got a 'check' (no 'check plus'). the poem was great, but not mine and not all physically written all that well, perhaps hence the average grade. So keep reading below for a few more poems that I did write at that age.
</blockquote>


<p>The second thing this makes me think is that I was so lucky to have such a great school system. Looking back through my 'school papers' from those years - thankfully my parents kept it all - I am amazed to find so many poems. I think there are about a hundred poems from the 4 years between 1978 and 1981 - that is crazy to me. Many of them are sort of mundane and not that memorable, but I was finding a style and working it out and it is obvious that it was not just one teacher but most if not all of them that encouraged me to write poems because they could see that I liked doing it. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montessori_method">Montessori</a> school for the win. I really can't overemphasize how that sort of environment helped me become the person that I am.</p>

<p>Here are two more that I enjoy, from just 2 months before my 7th birthday:</p>

<blockquote>Running Moon - March 13 1981

Sometimes when we drive out at night
I see the half moon thin and white.
It runs beside us like a hound
It's there whenever I turn around.
I say, "good moon, come on
good moon. It won't be long
we'll be home soon." And when
we stop there in the sky
the moon stands still
as still as I.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>Untitled - April 1 1981

Little snail,
Dreaming you go.
Weather and rose
Is all you know.
Weather and rose
Is all you see
Drinking the dewdrop's
Mystery.
