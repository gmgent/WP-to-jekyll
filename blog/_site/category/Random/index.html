It is possible that <strong>Somewhere</strong> gets by the gatekeeper for admission into the Radio Paradise playlist. That would be groovy. They are notoriously picky, and it is a privately run internet radio so it is up to the opinion of only 2 people. I am by no means approved yet but at least a song is getting reviewed now. The previous 5 were 'sorried' immediately. Oh the cruel whim of whimsy!<br />
<br />
Please support <a href="http://www.radioparadise.com/">Radio Paradise</a> because they are awesome.<br />

<blockquote>When we started our small business Facebook was a great way to reach our customers, and stay connected. I gave a lot of credit to it helping us get off the ground. Then things just started changing. We promoted posts for a few months, and it just didn't cut it. The way we sold on FB in the past was by building relationships with our customers…not posting an add. Also those posts adds up FAST!!! At the end of the month it was a nice chunk of money. All the pictures people sent in, and funny ones I posted weren't seen because I can't pay for all of them. Our sales dropped drastically. There are so many pages out there, and budgets are different for everyone. I know that some are paying for every post to be promoted because they are all over my feed. the pages like non-profits, and rescues are no where to be found. I get that FB needs to make money, and I don't mind paying a monthly fee. This isn't working for us, or any of the other small companies I talked with.</blockquote><br />

			        <p class="teaser_info">I have to say, this is a very interesting and original request. I have an old work acquaintance who contacted me and is putting on a show <em>a la</em> Jackson 5. He is a jazz lover and a detail-oriented person, which is why I think this is worth asking around. Apparently he had two singers already lined up but they didn't show up to practice and just pulled out of the project. The last I heard from him, we met up for a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charnett_Moffett">Charnett Moffett</a> show at the Catalina club, and now he is essentially MDing a show for his children and some family friends. They have been practicing for this show since May and need some vocalists to round out their sound.<br />
<br />
He is willing to pay $250 per head, which includes the performance and 2-3 practices. He needs one male and one female singer.<br />
<br />
If you are interested <a href="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/contact/">contact me</a> immediately and I will put you in touch with Michael.<br />
<br />
Details:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>We have  a band with my two sons, Miles (17), Max (5), and friends: Nikole (8),  Caren (21+), Roy (21+), Eric (21+).<br />
Max will be playing Drums, Guitar, and Violin.  Nikole will be singing on three songs (soloing on Lotus Flower). <br />
<br />
The show is primarily an opportunity for my sons to play together, Miles lives in Japan most of the year so they haven't <br />
had an opportunity to play together before.   Miles has been playing guitar, bass, and piano for about four years. Max<br />
has been playing drums & percussion & violin for about three years and guitar for about two years.<br />
<br />
As most of them are instrumentalists, it would be good to have vocalists so the music is much more interesting.<br />
<br />
We would have two rehearsals on Sunday August 5th, Sunday August 12, both at 3:00p.m. in Pasadena.<br />
And one rehearsal on Saturday August 18th at 11:00 am (most likely, still TBD).<br />
<br />
<br />
The website for the August 19th performance is here:<br />
<br />
    <a href="http://www.vanguardtheband.com/" title="www.vanguardtheband.com">http://www.vanguardtheband.com/</a> <br />
<br />
The working title of the  band is:  "Vanguard"<br />
We're only expecting one show at this time.<br />
<br />
</blockquote><br />
<br />
And the song list:<br />
<br />
1. Sweet Dreams   -  Eurythmics <br />
2. Lotus Flower -  Radiohead <br />

4. Lifetime - Maxwell <br />
5. Angel - Massive Attack <br />

			        <p class="teaser_info">When I was in Poetry school, we had to write a Canzone as part of the senior curriculum. I was just reminiscing about that in my mind and I realized that it is becoming a lost form. Petrarch had a very specific rhyme scheme for a Canzone, and it seems like people are forgetting that. The internets think it is just some loose italian folk poem, or something like that, but I assure you that at least in the school of Creative Writing in Madison in the 90's it was a very hardcore format. Writing a good Petrarchan canzone is like hitting a hole in one - it doesn't happen often and it should be celebrated. One day soon I will dig up the one I wrote for my senior thesis, but for now here is the form salvaged from <a href="http://www.poetrybase.info/forms/000/31.shtml">here</a>.<br />
<br />
<pre><br />
 <br />
Origin:	 	<br />
Italian<br />
<br />
 <br />
Schematic:	 	<br />
The rhyme scheme is as follows:<br />

abaacaaddaee<br />
eaeebeeccedd<br />
deddaddbbdee<br />
cdcceccaacbb<br />
bcbbdbbeebaa<br />
aedcb<br />
 <br />
Rhythm/Stanza Length:	 	<br />
12<br />
<br />
 <br />
Line/Poem Length:	 	<br />
65<br />

			        <p class="teaser_info">ISRC codes and other kinds of meta-information contained within songs allow us to track digital clone-copies across the infinite e-verse while keeping the related information consistent. The ISRC could be considered the primary key for each song and it consist of four codes for a total of 12 digits - country XX + identifier XXX + year XX + song number XXXXX.<br />
<br />
What this means is that for a given country, you have 3 digits to play with (the identifier) before you run out of codes. The number here is just under 50 thousand:<br />
<br />
<pre><br />
      alphanumeric = 26 alphabetical characters + 10 digits (0-9).<br />
 <br />
      36 ^ 3 = 46,656<br />
</pre><br />
<br />
I'm lucky I applied for mine early enough to get a 'US' designation, it seems that all new applications are being assigned 'QM' which is the new stand-in for US because they ran out of codes.<br />
<br />
Crazy!<br />
<br />
<a href="http://kristeraxel.com" title="Krister Axel" target="_blank">Krister Axel</a> and <a href="http://RockstarAlley.com" title="RockstarAlley" target="_blank">RockstarAlley</a> have the ISRC code: <strong>US Y3T</strong> and I suppose we were lucky to get it.<br />
<br />
I get a little worried for the next generation of songwriters because some of things I had access to are going away. It's harder to get into Pandora, or listed in Wikipedia, and those are small things - but that's all there is. Small things. Now there are no more US ISRC codes. <br />
<br />
What is the world coming to? :)<br />
<br />
Anyway, here are the codes for the new album. The last song is possibly subject to change because I have changed my mind a few times already. I have a confirmed mastering session in July for Gavin Lurssen to master Sky Meet Sea, so needless to say I am very excited. This will be the first time my mastering engineer has a few Grammys under his belt.<br />

			        <p class="teaser_info"><blockquote>According to an Orlando Sentinel story later confirmed by Sanford police, Zimmerman told authorities that after he briefly lost track of Martin, the teen approached him. After the two exchange words, Zimmerman said, he reached for his cell phone, and then Martin punched him in the nose. Zimmerman said Martin pinned him to the ground and began slamming his head into the sidewalk.</blockquote><br />
<br />
Because any 17-year-old would want to put down the skittles, after having lost his pursuer, and re-engage the fat scary 28-year-old who had been chasing him by somehow pinning the much larger aggressor to the ground and slamming his head into the pavement. That makes about as much sense as the idea that if you were getting your head slammed into the pavement you would be somehow all better by the time you show up at the police station.<br />

			        <p class="teaser_info">I'm going for another Bachelor's, this time a BS of Information Technology with an emphasis on databases. As part of a much larger initial assessment, I wrote this essay. The question was very broad - 'write about a challenge you have faced in your life and how you overcame it'.<br />
<br />
<blockquote>In answering this question, I think it is appropriate to talk about how I got started in the world of tech. Although I have had many challenges in my life, the one that seems most relevant in this context is the broad challenge I faced in moving from being a VBA developer in the late 90s to being the Ruby developer that I am now.<br />
When I graduated from college in 1997, I knew in my heart that I was going to need a career. I led a very successful rock band in Madison in those days, and it was tempting to just continue on that path, and live on the road and out of a suitcase for the rest of my life. The first challenge I faced was deciding what it was that I really wanted. I had had many changes of residence throughout my childhood and I finally understood then that what I needed was stability. I needed to grow roots. I decided to follow the girl I loved to Los Angeles and make a career there. We packed up a U-Haul with furniture, clothes, and a dog and off we went.<br />
The subsequent challenge I faced, aside from the general stranger-in-a-strange-land issues that are so common, was to find a viable career. I had a very short-lived run as an associate salesman at a music store on Santa Monica boulevard. That was not for me. I needed something artistic. I finally ended up as a temp in a very small employment office with only two other people, both headhunters. I was the only person with a technical mind, and it soon became necessary for me to set up the payroll system. By that I mean one day UPS showed up with a few boxes. A Unix system and a printer. It fell to me to understand the OS, hook up the monitor, connect the printer, data-enter all of the relevant information and start printing checks within a few days. My career path was born.<br />
The subsequent years would see me move from position to position, learning a little bit about everything. I learned how deep of a language SQL can be from a woman named Livia who was a geologist by trade and worked at FOX; I cut my teeth spec-writing for Toyota.  One interview that stands out in my memory was for TBG, where although I know next to nothing about Oracle databases I bought a large technical book the night before the interview and crammed for it like I was back in college. There were 3 questions on that entrance exam, and one of them had to do with indexes and clustering which I had just read about. If I had not spent the night before studying, I might not have been hired and I would probably still be a temp somewhere.<br />
There were many challenges I faced as part of the broader endeavor to find a career path for myself as a young professional. One was finding personal clarity about what I wanted out of life. Another was using circumstance to my benefit  and having the patience to build up my resume one temp position at a time. Finally, it never hurts to study up. I often think of a popular saying when I think about those years: 'fortune favors the bold'. In my case, it was more like 'fortune favors the prepared'.</blockquote><br />

			        <p class="teaser_info">We did it. We didn't train very much but still got through a pretty tough 13.1 miles. The starting line was at Universal city, we ran down Highland to Hollywood boulevard, all the way east to Vermont, and then retraced back up Highland and finished in Studio City. The last two miles were a serious problem for me. The hill was too much and I just cramped up completely.<br />
<br />
Here are our times:<br />

<br />
2 hours and 19 minutes on the nose for me, and for Lavinia just under 2 hours and 27 minutes. Not too shabby. We both wanted to beat 2.5 hours which we did.<br />
<br />
Also my splits were pretty interesting, I was on my way to a pretty great time except that the last two miles just killed me. That was far and away the fastest 10 miles I have ever run and then that hill put me in my place. Ah well.<br />

<br />
Sure, it was downhill, but I had a mile at 9 minutes, one at 8:10, and one at 8:30. For 3 consecutive miles, I was averaging 8 1/2 minute miles, which for me is pretty solid. Lavinia and I both had a great time. We love to run. A special shout-out to G-mama for taking care of the Moosh for us.<br />

<br />
"If love is truly going out of fashion, which I do not believe, then along with our nurtured indifference to each other will be an even more contemptuous indifference to each other's objects of reverence. I thought it was Iggy Stooge, you thought it was Joni Mitchell or whoever else seemed to speak for your own private, entirely circumscribed situation's many pains and few ecstasies. We will continue to fragment in this manner, because solipsism holds all the cards at present; it is a king whose domain engulfs even Elvis's. But I can guarantee you one thing; we will never agree on anything as we agreed on Elvis. So I won't bother saying goodbye to his corpse. I will say goodbye to you."<br />

			        <p class="teaser_info"><a href="http://axel.me/7s" title="the original article" target="_blank">link</a> to the original article from Slate - <strong>Did Early Christians Practice Birth Control?</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
So it's late, I don't feel like sleeping, and reading the comments on this one makes me want to write about it. It's a hot topic, a sensitive one, and the linked article is a good read. I can relate a little to the plight of atheists within what is quickly becoming a Christian nation, and there are many conversations to be had on this topic but I am going to try and pinpoint this issue I have with Christian literalism. Of course, I don't have to pick on the Christians - to my knowledge, Muslim culture, Jewish culture, and I'm sure many other religions I am less aware of have some element of literal belief within their faith - but I don't think it is a stretch to say, especially in light of this article, that the large group of fundamentalist Christians in this country that all believe in a literal interpretation of the bible is a unique social and political situation. We are the only advanced country with this reality. So much so that Obama had to make a concession to the churches that would not offer contraception to their employees. As smart as it is a political move, I think it is a slippery slope and we already see that it has opened the door to making the right-wing ideologues wonder how much more they can demand. So much for separation of church and state.<br />
<br />
Anyway here is what I wanted to talk about:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/religion.png"><img src="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/religion.png" alt="" title="religion" width="522" height="286" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1654" /></a><br />
<br />
It is a simple forum exchange between essentially two poles, we will call them Lefty and Abe. Of course Abe gets points for quoting <strong>Ferris Bueller</strong>, and essentially he is a likable guy who will go to any length to defend his belief system. Alternately, Lefty comes across a bit harsh but is making a salient point.<br />
<br />
Before I continue, I want to mention something that this whole exchange reminded me of. Perhaps some of you remember the tsunami that hit Japan last year - there was a great story (I can't find the link right now) that told of some indigenous tribes in Japan - essentially fishermen - who saw the tsunami coming because they had a traditional song that warned of the sea levels near shore dropping quickly. Apparently, before the 'big wave', the waters recede like a super-fast low tide and these illiterate subsistence fishermen knew that because they have a song passed down through countless generations that talks about that very specifically.<br />
<br />
That, to me, is the role of religion - which I guess is similar to the role of folklore and other vocal traditions - to pass along information from generation to generation. It doesn't have to be literal - those fishermen weren't concerned about who wrote the song, or when or if there had actually been a previous 'big wave', or anything nit-picky like that. They just sang their song every weekend and one day it came in handy.<br />
<br />
Greek mythology was a lot like that, and Roman, and even Norse - those are the ones I know something about - and the angle was always the same. Address issues that man is concerned with: why the sun rises, where the seasons come from, etc.; and then wrap it in a myth that can live longer than anyone. Harvests, or medicine, or astrology, or marriage - little nuggets of the people's wisdom would become lodged in a parable about Zeus, or Cupid, or Freyja. The point was not that these figures were real in a literal sense, but that behind the veneer of fickle gods engaged in decidedly mortal pursuits was a pithy comment on the human condition. Advice, even. But never heavy-handed - the lesson was always 'ignore at your peril', as opposed to 'sign on or be excluded'.<br />
<br />
Today, we have a grown man who is clearly genuine and sane and probably a nice guy to hang out with who is defending the literal truth of the entire bible, contradictions and all - cheerfully. No irony. No sign of cognitive dissonance whatsoever. I know this is nothing new, indeed we have millions of people like that in this country, but it is no less disturbing by virtue of its own ubiquity. I think everyone needs to take a moment to think about that. It's not just the 'dumb' people, as the harshest lefty critics would say, as Lefty himself might say. Very rational and very sane people somehow manage to find a way to put their theistic views completely aside from the rest of their belief system, and proceed through life with not a inkling that their own actions are in complete contradiction with their spiritual beliefs.<br />
<br />
For example - many fundamentalists claim - quite seriously - that earth was made, by god, about 4,000 years ago. It says that in the bible, apparently, and that being the authoritative source, means that it must be true.<br />
<br />
These very same people use coal-generated power, and cell-phones made with coltan, for example - both of which are products of an earth that is (correctly) 4 billion years old. You can't make coal in 4,000 years. It won't happen.<br />
<br />
So here's the thing about essentially all of Christian dogma - it was created by politicians. I hate to break it to you. As exhibit number one, I submit to you the farce known as 'the holy trinity':<br />
<br />
The whole concept of Jesus as 'deity' and most specifically the craziness that is the holy trinity (all 3 - holy ghost, the 'father' himself, and Jesus are different but equal manifestations of the divine) was specifically designed as a power-grab wedge issue. The holy trinity was meant to alienate the Hellenists and elevate what was at one point a minority group (the nascent Christians) to a position of control. It worked incredibly well - the Hellenists were ready to play ball and share power except as devout rationalists they just would not swallow the seriousness with which the Christians were selling this whole 3-beings-as-one concept. As polytheists, they were natural compromisers - there is plenty of room for your gods too - but then as now what was to become the Catholic church would settle for nothing less than complete domination.<br />
Christians in the 3rd and 4th centuries were very much the Tea Party of their time, and Jesus was the 'gay marriage' or 'job-stealing-immigrant' problem of that time - meant to to alienate their political opponents into irrelevancy or subjugation at the same time that they pushed the whole concept that the Christian 'godhead' is more 'real' than other gods. At the time, that seemed like an absurd tenet to most people but over the last 1800 years everyone seems to have forgotten that the story of Jesus was either appropriated from other religions like Mithras or literally debated into existence from whole cloth at the councils of Nicaea.<br />
<br />
Jesus was one of many influential prophets at the turn on the first millennium. 200+ years later, his story was appropriated for political purposes. Ironically, they use a greek word <em>homoousian</em> to describe the controversy that would in short order relegate the Hellenists to ancient history.<br />
<br />
I have no problem with religion whatsoever. Just don't tell me it is literally true. It feels like a very small step from believing in the literal truth of the bible, to submitting that creationism should be taught in school. It's irresponsible, counter-productive, and straight-up gauche.<br />

Klout seems to think I am influential on the topic of Georgia. I think that's funny.<br />
<br />
Yes, I have a song called Georgia Rain that has been successful lately but that hardly makes me a topic influencer. You be the judge. Maybe this song <em>is</em> a hit in Georgia.<br />

<blockquote><small>trivia: This is one of the only songs in the Axel catalog where I am playing what amounts to lead electric guitar. I had that guitar custom made for me in Madison in the summer of 1996. It is a strat body with a Nuno Bettencourt neck by <em>Washburn</em>, lol. Ash body and maple neck, I think. It is my only true left-handed instrument (with a right-handed bridge). My acoustic is just a regular guitar that I play flipped over.</small></blockquote><br />

<br />
<hr><br />
<br />
This whole conversation reminds me of a Hemingway quote, which is:<br />
<br />
'Write drunk. Edit sober.'<br />
<br />
Of course I am not encouraging people to run out and start drinking, but the point I think here is that there are two very distinct stages to creativity. I agree it is a choice, but it is also a process that can be understood (to some degree).<br />
<br />
Stage 1: let it flow. Write write write. Do NOT stand in your own way. Write as much as possible and NEVER self-censor. That is for stage 2. This is the creative muscle that needs to be exercised and to quote Voltaire: The perfect is the enemy of the good.<br />
<br />
Stage 2: look at what you wrote as if someone else wrote it. Feel free to move back to stage 1 if you get a good idea. Remember that 99% will be not usable and that is as it should be. Another good concept (I don't know who said this first): Kill your darlings. That means that if there is one thing that you are REALLY excited about, it might be a good idea to get rid of it. Superstar tidbits tend to get in the way of the whole. Be honest with yourself.<br />
<br />
Those two steps have served me well for 20+ years, and I got problems but a lack of creativity is not one of them. What tends to happen, I find, is that as you perfect this 2 step process, with the two steps so separated (flow versus scrutiny) your brain over time is actually able to do them simultaneously - and that is somewhere after your first 10,000 hours (read Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell for more on that). It is here that good things can occasionally just land on the page, fully realized. That is what people talk about when they say the song wrote itself. This has happened to me on many occasions and these are among my best works.<br />
<br />
Lastly, remember that this is not about you, it's about what you are writing or creating. I have never once been able to consciously direct or insert meaning into anything. If you get good at step 2 you will find that often if not always the good stuff is not what you expected or wanted - it is the stuff that was NOT consciously created. It is the stuff that just happened along the way. That is why step 1 is so important - you will never know if it is good until AFTER you have finished it. So don't judge yourself until you have walked away for a moment and can move on to step 2.<br />
<br />
Good luck everyone!<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: apparently, this is the original 'kill your darlings' quote:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch: 'Whenever you feel an impulse to perpetrate a piece of exceptionally fine writing, obey it - whole-heartedly - and delete it before sending your manuscripts to press. Murder your darlings'.</blockquote><br />
<br />
Later this phrase became 'In writing, you must kill your darlings' which has been attributed to William Faulkner.<br />

<br />
A fascinating discussion from Facebook. I heard about these peppers on Man vs. Food. Crazy. Also, I heard something from my wife about a guy she works with that did permanent damage to his stomach by eating these things.<br />
<br />
<blockquote>I have Ghost peppers growing in the garden. I looked them up on Wiki. Apparently in their native India, they are used to make hand grenades for crowd control. They also use them to make smoke bombs. And they smear them on fences to keep rouge [sic] elephants away. I've never grown weapons before. I'll don Kevlar and goggles come harvest time.</blockquote><br />
<br />
<br />
<blockquote>Pepper heat is measured in "Schoeville Units" [sic]. Tabasco sauce is approx 2,000-2,500 a habenero is around 20,000. A young, green Ghost is 600,000+, and a ripe red one is well over a million and a half. They're almost poison.</blockquote><br />
<br />
<strong>the punch line:</strong><br />
<br />
<blockquote><br />
This is 100% true. My son Aidan came back with some ghost chillis from a farmer's market. We didn't know how to cook them so we decided to fry them. Wrong move! All we did was turn the oil into an aerosole [sic] and essentially tear gassed our house. The pan we used had to be thrown out! The worst part, was no matter how much I washed my hands the traces of the oil was still on there and I had to take my contacts out. It was like I was pepper spraying my own eyes. One of the all time stupidest things I have ever done.</blockquote><br />

I cannot believe it has been 11 years since they closed their doors. They shut the company down early so as not to screw their employees out of a modest severance. Who would do that now?<br />

Head over to <a href="http://axelradio.com/album/swexico" title="bandcamp" target="_blank">bandcamp</a> and download the whole album for free (or whatever you can afford) if you like it. It's one of my favorites. The song is <strong>Illuminate The Sky</strong> from the EP <em>Swexico</em>.<br />

<br />
<blockquote><br />
I woke up today and my voice was <br />
Older than my heart <br />
Which carries a new scar <br />
The image of a better place <br />
Let me see the earth dressed <br />
For the seasons <br />
<br />
Diamonds in the street <br />
Spotlights in the wild <br />
Tonight I watch an angel <br />
Shoot across the sky <br />
Illuminate the sky <br />
<br />
Even as my dreams run slowly <br />
Beneath this printed sunset <br />
They begin to die <br />
We replace the impossible <br />
With the same wicked fever <br />
That burned heaven to the ground <br />
<br />
Diamonds in the street <br />
Spotlights in the wild <br />
Tonight I watch an angel <br />
Illuminate the sky <br />
Shoot across the sky <br />
<br />
I opened up my veins <br />
Showed you what I believe <br />
I hope you never change <br />
I hope you never change <br />
I hope you will always shine <br />
I hope you never change <br />
<br />
The stars in your eyes <br />
Illuminate the sky<br />
<br />

<br />
<blockquote>Talking to Kramer and Underkoffler, you really get a sense of just how much thought was put into this system. For example, Underkoffler brings up the “John Malkovitch [sic] problem” (referring to the film Being John Malkovitch which has a scene in which everyone in the world is John Malkovitch). You don't want to capture a part of the screen being presented and end up re-presenting a piece of the presentation. Again, all of these kinds of things had to be solved on the backend and UI levels. Underkoffler says they've solved almost everything, but there's still work to do perfecting this future of computing.</blockquote><br />

I love weird tech vernacular. Too bad TechCrunch can't spell Malkovich correctly.<br />

			        <p class="teaser_info">I saw a tweet about it from <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/ClaudeSuper">@ClaudeSuper<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/ClaudeSuper"></a> and I thought it was interesting. I've been seeing this quote moving around Facebook today and I should have realized it was becoming a national news item. The story is from <a href="http://mashable.com/2011/05/03/altered-mlk-quote/">Mashable</a>:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>Returning hate for hate multiplies hate, adding deeper darkness to a night already devoid of stars. Darkness cannot drive out darkness: only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate: only love can do that. Hate multiplies hate, violence multiplies violence, and toughness multiplies toughness in a descending spiral of destruction. So when Jesus says “Love your enemies,” he is setting forth a profound and ultimately inescapable admonition…. The chain reaction of evil — hate begetting hate, wars producing more wars — must be broken, or we shall be plunged into the dark abyss of annihilation.<br />
<br />
- Martin Luther King</blockquote><br />
<br />
A modified version of this quote has been going around Facebook:<br />
<br />
<blockquote><em>I mourn the loss of thousands of precious lives, but I will not rejoice in the death of one, not even an enemy.</em> Returning hate for hate multiplies hate, adding deeper darkness to a night already devoid of stars. Darkness cannot drive out darkness: only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate: only love can do that.</blockquote><br />
<br />
<br />
The first sentence (in italics, added by me) was written by <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/jmadly/">Jessica Dovey</a>, and came to be included in a tweet by <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/pennjillette">@pennjillete</a> that quickly went viral. It was incorrectly attributed to MLK in it's entirety, although the first sentence was not his. I think the message is still an important one and I agree with the premise of both the entire quote from MLK as well as the modified one. The world needs love that is for sure.<br />
<br />
UPDATE: interesting <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2011/05/03/propaganda_bin_laden/index.html">follow-up piece</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/ggreenwald/">@ggreenwald</a> on the media's role in spinning the story of bin Laden's killing - while possibly NOT holding a gun (he was unarmed), which is what the White House <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0511/54162.html">had said previously</a>.<br />

_____</p><br />
<p>One of my wife's distant friends has attempted to invite herself to stay with us, again. She did this last March, and we used the excuse of me starting a new job and needing to do x, y, and z as well as the "out of town" excuse for any remaining dates. This got us off scot-free, but we both knew the time would come again... and it's here. We need a final solution.</p><br />
<p>We live in a small 2 bedroom apartment, in New York City. People like to visit here, and they don't generally want to pay for a hotel. We understand this. However, we also don't want people staying with us who we don't know or don't like.</p><br />
<p>My wife received the following email (summarized):</p><br />
<p><i>I'm going to be in NYC the night of the 5th to the morning of the 15th for [blah blah blah some work-related singing event thing]. Maria (my boss) said it is on the lower east side at Gramercy Park. I do have another friend who offered me her place to stay, but not for the whole time. Is there a chance that I could stay with you and Jeff for a portion of that time? I'd be using the subway the whole time and I'd be gone from 10-10 probably every day, so I'd be out of your way most of the time. Let me know if this might be a possibility! Your choice on the dates, it's pretty flexible when I stay at her place. Thanks for your help - I hope this works out so we can see each other!<br /><br />
</i><br /><br />
Oh my god. First, I don't even know this woman. I've never even spoken with her. My wife doesn't really like her, but she's one of those people who just won't go away. To complicate things further, my wife is one of those people who doesn't really like to say no or to turn away people from her past, so I'm sure this woman will be following us wherever we go. Granted, they do have history in that they used to go to school together from ages 11-16. A decade ago. Then, they've seen each other sporadically when they've been home at the same time. This complicates the issue a little since it begs the question "does past history automatically equate to present friendship?" Even so, I'm reluctant to allow her stay because it'll set a precedent and possibly ruin the (slim) chances of her just fading into the past, and never hearing from her again.</p><br />
<p>Further, it really annoys me when people just invite themselves over, or present the possibility of you accommodating them. This is something I strive never to do. If anything, I might "test the waters" by mentioning I'll be in town, and see if an offer comes my way, but suggesting that you should allow me to stay in your apartment with you and your significant other whom I have not met seems borderline if not downright rude. Presumptuous, definitely.</p><br />
<p>I doubt this will be the last time this happens, so we need a final solution.</p><br />
<p>The only thing I've thought of so far are:</p><br />
<p>1. Our apartment has a weird key (true), and we haven't been able to get it duplicated (somewhat true). We need our keys (true). Sorry.</p><br />
<p>2. Keep it vague. "Sorry, that isn't going to work for us" seems like a pretty good solution, but a) it's still pretty awkward to say to someone, especially since I wouldn't put it beyond this woman to inquire further -- "Why, though? Why can't I stay?" -- and b) it'll be hard to get my wife to say this to her.</p><br />
<p>Have you had similar experiences? What would you do in this sort of situation? Is getting cornered into an unfortunate situation like this just a fact of life I'm refusing to accept? </p><br />
<p>and the response:<br /><br />
________</p><br />
<p>This is a classic case of Ask Culture meets Guess Culture.</p><br />
<p>In some families, you grow up with the expectation that it's OK to ask for anything at all, but you gotta realize you might get no for an answer. This is Ask Culture.</p><br />
<p>In Guess Culture, you avoid putting a request into words unless you're pretty sure the answer will be yes. Guess Culture depends on a tight net of shared expectations. A key skill is putting out delicate feelers. If you do this with enough subtlety, you won't even have to make the request directly; you'll get an offer. Even then, the offer may be genuine or pro forma; it takes yet more skill and delicacy to discern whether you should accept.</p><br />
<p>All kinds of problems spring up around the edges. If you're a Guess Culture person -- and you obviously are -- then unwelcome requests from Ask Culture people seem presumptuous and out of line, and you're likely to feel angry, uncomfortable, and manipulated.</p><br />
<p>If you're an Ask Culture person, Guess Culture behavior can seem incomprehensible, inconsistent, and rife with passive aggression.</p><br />
<p>Obviously she's an Ask and you're a Guess. (I'm a Guess too. Let me tell you, it's great for, say, reading nuanced and subtle novels; not so great for, say, dating and getting raises.)</p><br />
<p>Thing is, Guess behaviors only work among a subset of other Guess people -- ones who share a fairly specific set of expectations and signalling techniques. The farther you get from your own family and friends and subculture, the more you'll have to embrace Ask behavior. Otherwise you'll spend your life in a cloud of mild outrage at (pace Moomin fans) the Cluelessness of Everyone.</p><br />
<p>As you read through the responses to this question, you can easily see who the Guess and the Ask commenters are. It's an interesting exercise.<br /><br />

EDIT: some key comments added:<br />
<br />
<br />
It's really interesting that so many people think the request isn't rude. I think it's rude, or maybe a better word is pushy, to ask someone for a favor a second time after you've already been turned down once. I feel like the first refusal is the unspoken social signal that we hope people pick up on so that they don't put us in the position of having to be rude and say no a second time to a request for a favor. <br />
There's a lot of good advice about different ways of saying no - if it were me and I did want to have some future contact (but not a house guest), I would go with "No, we can't , have a great visit, let me know if you have time to meet up, etc..."<br />

Wow, gt2 -- I couldn't have asked for a clearer demo of Guess-type thinking, complete with the assumption that you should never "put [people] in the position of having to be rude and say no" -- italics mine. <br />
<br />
For comparably unmistakable Ask-type responses, see dobbs and tkolar.<br />

WTF? How on earth is this person being rude? Her email sounds quite polite to me. Your interpretation of it, however, is downright ghastly. Of course, just say no to her question, but crikey, don't blame her for asking it as it's perfectly reasonable. She probably has no idea you dislike her so which isn't surprising based on your post.<br />

Get over it. There's nothing rude about asking to crash at someone's place, particularly in your mid-twenties. <br />
<br />

<br />
The only unfortunate thing in this situation is the fact that your wife doesn't appear to be able to say "sorry, no" to someone asking a favor. That is a fact of life that you had better learn to accept.<br />
