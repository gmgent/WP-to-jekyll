<p>Fast friends ex-lovers unite
and be alone together
this is no wasteland, more
sex for all and all for sex
when secrets are not hidden
they need not be kept</p>

<p>I have not fallen, or made
sour any glances no false
words have crept from these lips
(that once embraced
your waist)
the memory of taste</p>

<p>The infinite Once, no more
no less than enough
if taste lingers well
then loss lingers too much;
one finger from a handshake
some fraction of an earthquake</p>

<p>Your taste, half sweet grace
a soft exquisite place
a bullet through flesh
fine feminine mesh. I
cherish the scars, tracing
your cheek among stars</p>

<p>And the sweep of your hip
the parade of senses - arrested
lost in the curve of your lips
losing a battle against them
the average day eclipsed
by the sugar of your skin</p>

<p>The infinite Once, so perfectly
begun. Such force of attraction
between bodies in motion
such gravity
such careless velocity
of casual emotion.</p>

<p>You are a sky among oceans
a belief among notions
such a deep silhouette
and delicious half-poison -
bringing death back to life
bringing dull to explosion</p>
