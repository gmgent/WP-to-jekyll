<p>what do I say to all that? Aside from, you have a way with words. I can
tell
you and I are going to get along famously! Even if we don't have that
badda
bing badda bang that some people have... at least I know I am comfortable
enough to make a new friend in this crazy town... I am not worried about
the
three week thing...actually it's a subconscious effort... I can't help it,
it just happens that way. But, it's not important is it?! Not really...</p>

<ul>
<li>I just proof-read this next paragraph, and realize that my grammar
sucks,
my sentences are really long, and you can forget about good sentence
structure. So, rather than fix it... I decided to say fuck it, forgive the
butchering of the english language... read on!!
What do I like to do for fun? Hmmm... I love work... workaholic I
suppose!
But, for fun, I go out with my friends... dinner-mostly sushi in Hermosa
Beach, because that's where all those silly girls live!, drinks in
hermosa,
hollywood, westwood, brentwood... you name it! If it's fun, you can pretty
much bet we'll do it. I am not a real TV person, so I don't spend a ton of
time in front of one, but when I do watch, I am almost catatonic... it
sucks
me in! not that I enjoy it all that much! Um...I completely enjoy some
alone
time now and then. I like grabbing a good book, a pad of paper, my
favorite
pen of the week (I have a pen thing, if I find one I love, I won't let go
of
it! Sick, eh?!), my smokes and reading glasses and going to a coffee shop
to
just sit and ponder life, people, and what-not. My idea of a great day is
waking up to coffee and a smoke, showering, sitting around in my robe for
a
bit, then getting dressed going somewhere public and writing, then going
home having sex with George Cloony (just kidding!), taking another shower,
and going out with my friends for some drunk pleasurable partying (ie.
dancing and drinking). I have this thing about dancing though, I have to
be
drunk enough to get into it... and when I do it, it's with wreckless
abandon. So, that's me... I like reading, writing, talking, watching,
driving, drinking an orgasmic glass of wine, kissing, and looking up at
the
stars to make a wish everynight. What do I wish for? Depends on the
night...
mostly it's that everything will work out in my life... but I don't really
have to wish for that, even though it makes me feel better when I do.</li>
</ul>


<p>I love to travel, but I also realize that I can tell you all about this
stuff in person... it's good to save some things for later.</p>

<p>As for whatever it is you look like... you said to picture you as a young
child... well, that's a bit of a turn off...sorry to say! I just can't
seem
to get into the whole idea... I have a little brother so it's kinda making
me sick. So, here's the deal, I am sending you a picture of me from
August... I was in Hawaii, drinking a mai-tai and having a great time with
the family... you can tell by the look on my face. Call me crazy for
actually sending you a picture, but I figure it's a better way to know who
the hell you are telling your childhood stories to.</p>

<p>I'm leaving in about 45 minutes, please write back... or write my hotmail
account if it's later.... I want to hear what you have to say to all this
hooplah! And, please don't tell me I make you sick... that would really be
a
blow to my ego.</p>

<p>I guess I should explain a little...
at the risk of going a little too far in depth, picture me as a young
child...
I am the youngest of three, two older sisters.
My father is seventeen years older than my mother. Before I moved back to
Paris in 1985, we lived in White Plains, a relatively affluent suburb of
New
York City, in Westchester county. It wasn't quite Rochester, or New
Rochelle
- that was upper class - but we were like upper middle class... I guess
the
difference is, expensive domestics - Cadillacs - as opposed to BMWs, or
something.
In any case, we had a beautiful, enormous house. In 1982, for example, I
was
8 years old, and my mother was still in her 30s. I went to school just a
few
blocks away. Sometimes my mother would walk me to school. Other times, she
would pick me up for lunch. Those were good days. At the age of 37, my
mother was still completely stunning. I was finally thinning out a little,
but I was this chubby little dude with a whole mess of curly hair and a
big
smile. We drove a nice Volvo, lived in this great house, I was put into
this
advanced program in school - life was better than great. That, initially,
is
what life was to me. Everyone was beautiful, there were no problems with</p>

<h2>money or otherwise, living was just like marching in a parade or something</h2>

<p>I knew where I was going...
And then, we moved to Paris - the second time. Next thing you know, I'm
smoking hashish and cigarettes, drinking Johnny Walker - I got quite a
jumpstart - I started writing music on the piano. I was growing up.
And then, all of a sudden - my sisters both graduated, my parents
divorced,
I spent 6 months with my mother in Paris and then got shipped back to NY
to
finish High School.</p>

<p>I think it was around this time that started asking myself, what the hell
just happened? Where did all the beauty go?</p>

<p>And now, as an adult, I get the chance to see my mother once in a great
while. The last time she came to visit, this past September, we got to
talk
a lot. That may have been the first real peer-to-peer dialogue that we
have
ever had.
I'm trying to remember exactly who she was referring to... It may have
been
the guy that came to deliver the couch that she helped me buy from Ikea.
But she said, really casually - "not very attractive, is he?" - with a
little curl of the lips. Like he was doing her a disservice, or he was
directly insulting her with his looks.
And I felt this whole wave of resentment towards her. I still don't really
understand it.
I think I felt like it was a revelation, like all of a sudden I realized
that my mother was biased against ugly people.
But I am too - when I see someone who I find strikingly unattractive, I am
actually fascinated. And who am I to make judgements about the way some
people perceive and react to other people? Making judements about people
who
are judgemental is like the pot calling the kettle black. It doesn't make
any sense.</p>

<p>I don't even know why I'm telling you this, except to explain that if I am
touchy about being 'aesthetically judgemental', it's because I still don't
know why that little comment of my mother's bothered me so much. But I am
guilty also - it's human nature.
It's Darwinism, for crying out loud...
And I think it's a little bit of guilt, because all of my life I've known
that I'm pretty easy on the eyes. But if anything, physical beauty is a
curse, because it tricks you into believing it's actually worth something
by
itself - which it isn't...</p>

<p>Wow, I just got pretty deep.</p>

<p>Not bad for an explanation, though, eh?</p>

<p>And as for your three week test phase, I imagine the key is to not worry
about it (for me at least).</p>

<p>I totally agree, if it's not fun, it's not worth it.
So let's just have fun.</p>

<p>What do you like to do, aside from writing long emails? (which I'm getting
pretty good at, also)</p>
