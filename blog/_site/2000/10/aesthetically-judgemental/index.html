<br />
<p>what do I say to all that? Aside from, you have a way with words. I can<br />
tell<br />
you and I are going to get along famously! Even if we don't have that<br />
badda<br />
bing badda bang that some people have... at least I know I am comfortable<br />
enough to make a new friend in this crazy town... I am not worried about<br />
the<br />
three week thing...actually it's a subconscious effort... I can't help it,<br />
it just happens that way. But, it's not important is it?! Not really...</p><br />
<br />
<ul><br />
<li>I just proof-read this next paragraph, and realize that my grammar<br />
sucks,<br />
my sentences are really long, and you can forget about good sentence<br />
structure. So, rather than fix it... I decided to say fuck it, forgive the<br />
butchering of the english language... read on!!<br />
What do I like to do for fun? Hmmm... I love work... workaholic I<br />
suppose!<br />
But, for fun, I go out with my friends... dinner-mostly sushi in Hermosa<br />
Beach, because that's where all those silly girls live!, drinks in<br />
hermosa,<br />
hollywood, westwood, brentwood... you name it! If it's fun, you can pretty<br />
much bet we'll do it. I am not a real TV person, so I don't spend a ton of<br />
time in front of one, but when I do watch, I am almost catatonic... it<br />
sucks<br />
me in! not that I enjoy it all that much! Um...I completely enjoy some<br />
alone<br />
time now and then. I like grabbing a good book, a pad of paper, my<br />
favorite<br />
pen of the week (I have a pen thing, if I find one I love, I won't let go<br />
of<br />
it! Sick, eh?!), my smokes and reading glasses and going to a coffee shop<br />
to<br />
just sit and ponder life, people, and what-not. My idea of a great day is<br />
waking up to coffee and a smoke, showering, sitting around in my robe for<br />
a<br />
bit, then getting dressed going somewhere public and writing, then going<br />
home having sex with George Cloony (just kidding!), taking another shower,<br />
and going out with my friends for some drunk pleasurable partying (ie.<br />
dancing and drinking). I have this thing about dancing though, I have to<br />
be<br />
drunk enough to get into it... and when I do it, it's with wreckless<br />
abandon. So, that's me... I like reading, writing, talking, watching,<br />
driving, drinking an orgasmic glass of wine, kissing, and looking up at<br />
the<br />
stars to make a wish everynight. What do I wish for? Depends on the<br />
night...<br />
mostly it's that everything will work out in my life... but I don't really<br />
have to wish for that, even though it makes me feel better when I do.</li><br />
</ul><br />
<br />
<br />
<p>I love to travel, but I also realize that I can tell you all about this<br />
stuff in person... it's good to save some things for later.</p><br />
<br />
<p>As for whatever it is you look like... you said to picture you as a young<br />
child... well, that's a bit of a turn off...sorry to say! I just can't<br />
seem<br />
to get into the whole idea... I have a little brother so it's kinda making<br />
me sick. So, here's the deal, I am sending you a picture of me from<br />
August... I was in Hawaii, drinking a mai-tai and having a great time with<br />
the family... you can tell by the look on my face. Call me crazy for<br />
actually sending you a picture, but I figure it's a better way to know who<br />
the hell you are telling your childhood stories to.</p><br />
<br />
<p>I'm leaving in about 45 minutes, please write back... or write my hotmail<br />
account if it's later.... I want to hear what you have to say to all this<br />
hooplah! And, please don't tell me I make you sick... that would really be<br />
a<br />
blow to my ego.</p><br />

<p>I guess I should explain a little...<br />
at the risk of going a little too far in depth, picture me as a young<br />
child...<br />
I am the youngest of three, two older sisters.<br />
My father is seventeen years older than my mother. Before I moved back to<br />
Paris in 1985, we lived in White Plains, a relatively affluent suburb of<br />
New<br />
York City, in Westchester county. It wasn't quite Rochester, or New<br />
Rochelle<br />
- that was upper class - but we were like upper middle class... I guess<br />
the<br />
difference is, expensive domestics - Cadillacs - as opposed to BMWs, or<br />
something.<br />
In any case, we had a beautiful, enormous house. In 1982, for example, I<br />
was<br />
8 years old, and my mother was still in her 30s. I went to school just a<br />
few<br />
blocks away. Sometimes my mother would walk me to school. Other times, she<br />
would pick me up for lunch. Those were good days. At the age of 37, my<br />
mother was still completely stunning. I was finally thinning out a little,<br />
but I was this chubby little dude with a whole mess of curly hair and a<br />
big<br />
smile. We drove a nice Volvo, lived in this great house, I was put into<br />
this<br />
advanced program in school - life was better than great. That, initially,<br />
is<br />
what life was to me. Everyone was beautiful, there were no problems with</p><br />
<br />
<h2>money or otherwise, living was just like marching in a parade or something</h2><br />
<br />
<p>I knew where I was going...<br />
And then, we moved to Paris - the second time. Next thing you know, I'm<br />
smoking hashish and cigarettes, drinking Johnny Walker - I got quite a<br />
jumpstart - I started writing music on the piano. I was growing up.<br />
And then, all of a sudden - my sisters both graduated, my parents<br />
divorced,<br />
I spent 6 months with my mother in Paris and then got shipped back to NY<br />
to<br />
finish High School.</p><br />
<br />
<p>I think it was around this time that started asking myself, what the hell<br />
just happened? Where did all the beauty go?</p><br />
<br />
<p>And now, as an adult, I get the chance to see my mother once in a great<br />
while. The last time she came to visit, this past September, we got to<br />
talk<br />
a lot. That may have been the first real peer-to-peer dialogue that we<br />
have<br />
ever had.<br />
I'm trying to remember exactly who she was referring to... It may have<br />
been<br />
the guy that came to deliver the couch that she helped me buy from Ikea.<br />
But she said, really casually - "not very attractive, is he?" - with a<br />
little curl of the lips. Like he was doing her a disservice, or he was<br />
directly insulting her with his looks.<br />
And I felt this whole wave of resentment towards her. I still don't really<br />
understand it.<br />
I think I felt like it was a revelation, like all of a sudden I realized<br />
that my mother was biased against ugly people.<br />
But I am too - when I see someone who I find strikingly unattractive, I am<br />
actually fascinated. And who am I to make judgements about the way some<br />
people perceive and react to other people? Making judements about people<br />
who<br />
are judgemental is like the pot calling the kettle black. It doesn't make<br />
any sense.</p><br />
<br />
<p>I don't even know why I'm telling you this, except to explain that if I am<br />
touchy about being 'aesthetically judgemental', it's because I still don't<br />
know why that little comment of my mother's bothered me so much. But I am<br />
guilty also - it's human nature.<br />
It's Darwinism, for crying out loud...<br />
And I think it's a little bit of guilt, because all of my life I've known<br />
that I'm pretty easy on the eyes. But if anything, physical beauty is a<br />
curse, because it tricks you into believing it's actually worth something<br />
by<br />
itself - which it isn't...</p><br />
<br />
<p>Wow, I just got pretty deep.</p><br />
<br />
<p>Not bad for an explanation, though, eh?</p><br />
<br />
<p>And as for your three week test phase, I imagine the key is to not worry<br />
about it (for me at least).</p><br />
<br />
<p>I totally agree, if it's not fun, it's not worth it.<br />
So let's just have fun.</p><br />
<br />
<p>What do you like to do, aside from writing long emails? (which I'm getting<br />
pretty good at, also)</p><br />
