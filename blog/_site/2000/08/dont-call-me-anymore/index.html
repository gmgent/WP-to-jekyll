<p>Whatever</p>

<p>Maybe I should write another poem
Maybe I should drink some more poison
Maybe there's no difference between love and
frustration</p>

<p>Maybe I haven't wasted anything
It seems so sudden, this shift
This earthquake. But the sky was dark for months</p>

<p>And where do I find peace, now?
Which way to something better, forgiveness
I hate myself for being your victim</p>

<p>I still fantasize about your body but
Now I have nightmares about your friendship
About the words you never could say</p>

<p>If you love me, you still don't know why
And it doesn't make you happy
So why should it matter?</p>

<p>If I told you how many times I've said
To myself: "You aren't going to call her ever again,
unless..."
You wouldn't believe it</p>

<p>Unless this, or that - if you'd call by Friday
If you fucked me well, blew me whatever
Unless nothing is the logical end</p>

<p>I feel no more pain, I should thank you
For that but I won't
I've been numb for a month now</p>

<p>If I could have it all again
All the time I should have spent
Instead of wasting it on love</p>

<p>like I didn't have enough</p>

<p>I knew in San Francisco, you took your dog
And left me on the phone with Reception
"I will be alone tonight, in fact..."</p>

<p>I can't be let down anymore
I can't love you like this, anymore
You chose your path
I am choosing mine
I choose no more disappointment
A dusty road in August
Away from Ohio
Tell your mother you lost a friend
Somewhere in West Hollywood</p>

<p>Goodbye</p>

<p>k</p>
