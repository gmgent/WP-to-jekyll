Subject:    RE: good morning</p>

<p>there once was a girl
who never asked for what she wanted
so she never quite knew
there were good things and bad things
always there were gifts and people who adored her
but nothing ever made her completely happy.
So she said to herself:</p>

<pre><code>Maybe if I can make everyone in the world love me
maybe that will make me happy
to know that no one ever thinks badly of me
</code></pre>

<p>so she tried really hard, to always say the nicest things
and to always listen, and to go wherever she needed to
and always smile at people and to always seem happy, at least</p>

<p>but there were always people she hadn't met
that looked at her, suspiciously
and she was convinced they were thinking bad thoughts about her
and it only made her feel worse
so she said to herself:</p>

<pre><code>Maybe if I keep moving around, I will find the perfect place
and everything will be right
and I will know where it is that I was meant to stay
</code></pre>

<p>so she travelled, and spent lots of money
she saw Rome and Cairo and Bangkok and Rio
and everywhere in between
and she had fun, she stayed busy
but one day, she woke up in a hotel
and felt something was missing
there was an emptiness about her
and she realized that she missed her home
but she didn't know where that was anymore</p>

<p>So she said to herself:</p>

<pre><code>Maybe if I don't listen to anyone
and always do what I want without thinking
and be completely selfish
maybe that will make me happy
</code></pre>

<p>so she never thought about anyone
and always pushed her way to the front of the line
and took the best seats
and double-parked, and never shared with anyone
but she realized she was lonely, and that wasn't working either.</p>

<p>So, she was finally in very much despair
she had tried everything
and still wasn't happy
so she asked her friend emma what to do</p>

<p>and emma said - I know just the thing
you should have sex with my friend krister
he'll cheer you right up</p>

<p>so that's what she did
and she never stopped smiling</p>

<p>:)</p>
