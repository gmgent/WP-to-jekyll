Subject:    RE: good morning</p><br />
<br />
<p>there once was a girl<br />
who never asked for what she wanted<br />
so she never quite knew<br />
there were good things and bad things<br />
always there were gifts and people who adored her<br />
but nothing ever made her completely happy.<br />
So she said to herself:</p><br />
<br />
<pre><code>Maybe if I can make everyone in the world love me<br />
maybe that will make me happy<br />
to know that no one ever thinks badly of me<br />
</code></pre><br />
<br />
<p>so she tried really hard, to always say the nicest things<br />
and to always listen, and to go wherever she needed to<br />
and always smile at people and to always seem happy, at least</p><br />
<br />
<p>but there were always people she hadn't met<br />
that looked at her, suspiciously<br />
and she was convinced they were thinking bad thoughts about her<br />
and it only made her feel worse<br />
so she said to herself:</p><br />
<br />
<pre><code>Maybe if I keep moving around, I will find the perfect place<br />
and everything will be right<br />
and I will know where it is that I was meant to stay<br />
</code></pre><br />
<br />
<p>so she travelled, and spent lots of money<br />
she saw Rome and Cairo and Bangkok and Rio<br />
and everywhere in between<br />
and she had fun, she stayed busy<br />
but one day, she woke up in a hotel<br />
and felt something was missing<br />
there was an emptiness about her<br />
and she realized that she missed her home<br />
but she didn't know where that was anymore</p><br />
<br />
<p>So she said to herself:</p><br />
<br />
<pre><code>Maybe if I don't listen to anyone<br />
and always do what I want without thinking<br />
and be completely selfish<br />
maybe that will make me happy<br />
</code></pre><br />
<br />
<p>so she never thought about anyone<br />
and always pushed her way to the front of the line<br />
and took the best seats<br />
and double-parked, and never shared with anyone<br />
but she realized she was lonely, and that wasn't working either.</p><br />
<br />
<p>So, she was finally in very much despair<br />
she had tried everything<br />
and still wasn't happy<br />
so she asked her friend emma what to do</p><br />
<br />
<p>and emma said - I know just the thing<br />
you should have sex with my friend krister<br />
he'll cheer you right up</p><br />
<br />
<p>so that's what she did<br />
and she never stopped smiling</p><br />
<br />
<p>:)</p><br />
