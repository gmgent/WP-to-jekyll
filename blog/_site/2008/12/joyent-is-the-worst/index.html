<p>CONTRARY TO ANYTHING I HAVE SAID PREVIOUSLY, Joyent offers some of the worst customer service around. JOYENT has no idea what is going on. They don&#039;t even read the support tickets, their documentation is old and useless. They are a dinosaur.<br />
I imagine their clients are all catching on right now and starting to jump off of that sinking ship. I pulled my last account off of this horrible Rails hosting service this year, I will NEVER go back.</p>


<p>I hate bad service. Bad value, too.</p>
