For Europeans and Asians, whose currencies are appreciating against the dollar, oil prices are not rising, and may even be falling.</i></p>




<p>There is something really wrong here. I have a new job, I've been working in this new office in Santa Monica which I walk to (sweet!), and I just happened to find myself examining a copy of US Weekly. We don't have a lot of magazines up in here, so cut me a break. Anyway, this is the extent of political coverage in it - I looked through the whole thing for something mildly political and/or cerebral.</p>


<p>Here it is -<br />
<b><br />
Heidi Montag, who has been hailed as a feminist hero, is voting for John McCain. 'I am a republican, and he has a lot of experience', says Heidi, who grew up in Colorado. </b></p>


<p>That's it - that is the entire reference. Young girls everywhere are being taught that a vacuous statement like that could (a) come from someone hailed as a 'feminist hero', (b) somehow equate to political awareness. Sheesh.</p>


<p>Oh yeah, and by the way, she has been <i>hailed by some</i> as a 'feminist hero' because - wait for it - she had a mean boyfriend once. I swear, you can't make this stuff up. I don't know who she is, apparently she is on TV somewhere, but she is being quoted by a publication with a readership in the millions that targets a very specific tween + teen demographic, and that makes her a significant role model as sad as it is to say that. Conclusion: we need better role models.<br />
<i><br />
Melman ... went further to argue that military production has a kind of viral impact across the economy, that sickens the whole system. One example: if investors see higher returns in military industries, they will shift their investments away from other industries, leaving them starved for capital.<br />
