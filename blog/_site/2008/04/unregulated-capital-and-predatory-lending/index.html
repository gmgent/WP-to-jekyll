I was in San Francisco (S.F.) this weekend, and I happened to read an article in the S.F. Chronicle, which to my knowledge is a reputable new source. I am used to mainstream media butchering reality, but I guess this story riles me extra because Northern California is (purportedly) a haven of progressivism. Anyway, in a classic case of both irresponsible journalism and academic blowing smoke up your ass,  Sam Zuckerman really misses the point.</p>


<p>The link to the original article is below, but many of you won't read it so allow me to just quote the passages that are especially odious.</p>


<p><i>In effect, the United States has maxed out on its national credit card. Like it or not, that's one of the most important things now forcing a new standard of frugality on free-spending Americans.</i></p>


<p>Without mentioning the root causes for this phenomenon in terms of both political and fiscal accountability, Sam is either trying too hard to snare readers or worse, deliberately missing the point. The truth is that the only reason the credit spigot is drawing down is because the World Bank, the Fed, and the US government are being run by a bunch of elite-obsessed jackasses. It's not that I'm in favor of more US federal deficit spending but insinuating that somehow the US consumer 'had this coming' is a little like blaming the tree for totaling the car in a DWI. Paul Wolfowitz, Ben Bernanke and George Bush are <i>still</i> drunk behind the wheel. Alan Greenspan deserves his share of the blame as well.</p>


<p>another quote:<br />
<i>As difficult as the adjustment may be, experts say the change is important medicine. To take one example, we're moving into a period when loan standards are more realistic. Home buyers now have to put money down and pay interest appropriate for their level of creditworthiness.</i></p>


<p>It is positively ludicrous to suggest that it takes a complete meltdown of the domestic financial sector to impose common-sense regulations. Isn't that part of the mandate for the Federal Reserve in the first place, to ensure price stability? And who are these 'experts', anyway?</p>


<p>This is what Sam lists as his sources: Chronicle research, BudgetSavvyMag.com</p>


<p>Really? A staff writer for a respected newspaper in a progressive  and academic community quotes nothing reputable for a front page story in the Sunday edition? BudgetSavvyMag.com is hardly a source for anything but shopping tips, and 'Chronicle research' in essence means nothing at all coming from said journalist. If listing oneself as a source is now kosher then the logical end is one writer with multiple pseudonyms quoting himself religiously and to great effect within the letter of the law.</p>


<p>It pains me to know that most of the US will never really know where this credit storm came from. At the risk of oversimplifying, I will just put it this way:<br />
<b>Unregulated capital:</b> Since Reagan and his voodoo economics in the 1980s, the US financial sector has been systematically deregulated. One net effect of this change was that 'reserves' were no longer monitored in a meaningful way. Think of a blackjack addict who is forced to put 40-50% of his paycheck into a savings account every weekend BEFORE he goes to the casino. And then one day, that is a rule that he no longer has to follow (see <a href="http://www.wsws.org/articles/1999/nov1999/bank-n01.shtml" target="_blank">this article</a> for more info).</p>


<p><b>Predatory lending:</b> See above, once all of this newly unregulated cash was on the market, it had to be put somewhere. Enter 'sub-prime borrowers'. Overnight, the mortgage industry invented a new loan consumer class and started marketing mortgages very aggressively to anyone with a pulse. Most of these sub-prime borrowers had no idea what they were in for. Many of them did not even speak english. Greenspan and then Bernanke made it worse by (a) looking the other way for these shady loans and (b) feeding the credit bubble by keeping interest rates low.</p>


<p>Anyway, I have now concluded that 99% of mainstream media is pure doggerel. Sam leaves out enough important points to fill a grain silo. The blogs I read on SmirkingChimp.com are routinely more insightful and far more academically sound, both in terms of footnotes and logical argument. Let us all be thankful for the independent political blogging community sticking to the facts and using quotable sources, because writers like Sam Zuckerman are really stinking up the place.</p>
