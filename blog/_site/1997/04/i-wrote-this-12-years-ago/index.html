<p>just this little stash of survival
never had a moment to think
radio voices sound like someone I know
moonlight makes me want to have a drink
I listen to the rhythm of the traffic
hiding in the silence I project
push me through the womb of the future
bear me as an infant to protect
an island on the ocean planet 'solo'
wailing of the unborn tragedy
wiping from my eyes the mess of martyrs
the burden of my passage through the freeze</p>
