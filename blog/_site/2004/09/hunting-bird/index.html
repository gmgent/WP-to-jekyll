<p>thoughts of pale colors<br />
faded with time<br />
secrets written with hope<br />
this sacred routine<br />
shines like a dull penny<br />
and I feel a new gravity<br />
beginning again.<br />
circles collide and it is<br />
not an illusion<br />
only one road<br />
with infinite scope<br />
I exist<br />
to feel the pressure of love<br />
like a hunting bird circles<br />
before the kill<br />
is it now?<br />
said the mule<br />
looking up<br />
at a shadow</p>
