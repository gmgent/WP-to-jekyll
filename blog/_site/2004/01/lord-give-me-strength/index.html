	                            <p><p>My last entry was April of last year.</p>

<p>It is now January 2004 and I am going to start writing again. Maybe it is merely the inability to write something positive that has kept me from it, I don't know. I just have to start keeping track of my thoughts like I used to.</p>

<p>I know I was not feeling very positive about everything. Not at all. I was disappointing myself, by being disappointed. I wish I could just do everything I want. At points, that would take at least two people, if not more. That's why I have to make decisions.</p>

<p>Ok, pros and cons. Pro: I would see Japan and Australia in the same trip. A â€˜Pacific Rim' tour, as she said herself, and fuck did that sound good. Seeing the whole world in one year, in good hotels. Con: I would devastate a very good old friend, as well as few good new friends. Probably take a step backwards in my social arena, by not being around. Entirely and assuredly jeopardize my financial future in the middle to long term as far as having a steady income. Pro: this would be my first real pro gig, for good money as far as it lasts. An entry for the musical resume, with a good chance of landing nice endorsements and sponsorships. I would have to make a few good contacts on a tour like this. Con: the music is not great. Not terrible, but not great. Would NOT be a terribly hip endeavor.
I am scattered. Have been always. I have to quit smoking but I can't, want to be independent but not yet. I still have not found a way to really enjoy social interactions the way I should. My truest joys I still find alone.
Where does it leave me?
Trying to make the best of what could be a great opportunity, but the call of land unexplored is making me crazy. God, this love of guitar has all of a sudden diluted my destiny. I wanted to play with Alex so that I can be a better guitarist. Now, I have to decide between that and seeing the world, traveling, finding myself again. If only we had more than one chance.
I can't decide. I have to, it will be soon, but I am still crazy - Japan, in 5 or 6 weeks. How do you argue against that, food for the soul? Time alone, like I love.
But I made promises, to myself and to others. Finish what you start. Follow your instincts, the first ones. Do it for love.
So what do I love more: the world, or friendship? It's as simple as that. Everything else would fall into place, either way.
I did the math, and the chances of me making more or less the same are high, with a decent chance of actually making and keeping more money than I do now, until the end of the year. That's a long time. It could really be a different world by then, in ways I don't know.
But here's a con: I might really be on to something, with what I'm doing right now. Playing heavy rock guitar in a cool band, following the dream as I know it in one form; in my hometown, which could only be good thing for my own personal pursuits.
Oh but I love to be on the road. Even for a shit ass country band.</p>

<p>Lord give me strength.</p>
