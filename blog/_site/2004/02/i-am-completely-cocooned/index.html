                I am completely cocooned
            </h2>
			<p>Talk to me, I want to say to myself. What is going on in there?
I'm depressed. I don't know why, it doesn't make sense, I should be proud but I'm not. I've lost the fire; I don't know where it went.
I'm plagued with questions - what is best for me?
Why am I so concerned with time?
Have I accepted that I destined to be an introvert?
Am I nurturing my musical gifts correctly?
Why do I have such a nasty problem with insecurity?
Why are my relationships so short-lived?
What am I trying to do?
Am I just starved for love?</p>

<p>I feel like I don't have anything to say. I feel like I can't relate to people. For some reason, I feel like it's my fault for not learning how. At the same time, I am reminded on occasion that I am found to be very sexy by some people. It confounds me. I have very little love of self - which makes me sensitive to the fact that not everyone likes me. What the fuck is that?
I've got a real list of talents - musical, lyrical, physical, programmableâ€¦Why is it not enough? Why am I always looking for justification?
I have to start talking. I have got to get through this.
There's really no problem here. Everything is in place. I just have to start toeing it. Focus. This whole young man old man thing is over. I am where and what I am because of destiny. You have gift you must never waste it. I have made the right choices.
I want to get to the point where I don't feel like a failure. I know that sounds childish, but there it is.
Failure.
I fail every day - to impress, to intoxicate, to assimilate to regurgitate. To rejoice. To release.
I am completely cocooned.</p>
