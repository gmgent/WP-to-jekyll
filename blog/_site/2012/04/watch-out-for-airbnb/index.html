                watch out for airbnb
            </h2>
			<p>I tried out airbnb for a wedding this past weekend, and the verdict is in. I never got my keys, because the host wanted me to wait until 7:30pm to 'drop them off'; so I had nowhere to go, so I booked into another hotel. Now they tell me that 'In our estimation, operating by the terms of the pre-agreed cancellation policy is the fairest possible resolution for this situation.'</p>

<p>So if I show up at your place and you are not there to meet me, it's my fault you are not there. And you get to keep my money. Airbnb robbed me of $900. My wife was in tears and I cannot believe this company is allowed to just screw me over like that. I really have never been treated this badly, by anyone in the hospitality industry.</p>

<p>After checking with the Better Business Bureau, it turns out Airbnb gets a big fat well-deserved <strong><a href="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/2012/03/airbnb-consumer-review-ratings-at-f/">F</a></strong>. I am not surprised.</p>

<p>Here is what happened:</p>

<blockquote>airbnb: stay at this amazing loft in San Francisco!
</blockquote>




<blockquote>me: ok, I'll take it.
</blockquote>




<blockquote>airbnb: check-in is after 3pm.
</blockquote>




<blockquote>me: ok, I'll be there between 5p and 6p because my plane lands after 4pm;
</blockquote>




<blockquote>airbnb host person: I have a practice from 3:30p - 7p, so I will have to drop the keys off at 7:30p. Where will you be?
</blockquote>




<blockquote>me: uh, ok, I guess that is the only option (wondering why I'm just hearing about this)...
</blockquote>




<blockquote>airbnb host person: you can also come pick them yourself if you would like - 5 miles away from the host address.</blockquote>




<blockquote>me: I don't have a car.</blockquote>




<blockquote>airbnb host person: no answer.
</blockquote>


<p>And that was it. I called <a href="http://www.airbnb.com/">airbnb</a> support and they called her, and that whole day before I landed at 4pm it was only radio silence. I landed at SFO knowing two things - that I had not heard from <a href="http://www.airbnb.com/">airbnb</a> or the host, and that the host was in a practice 5 miles away from where I was going and had no interest in helping me before 7:30pm. So I did what any reasonable person would do, I rebooked somewhere else. Now I have been forced to turn to the <a href="https://goldengate.app.bbb.org/complaint/view/57223227/c/w3y78z">Better Business Bureau</a> to at least have a forum for my complaint. By the next day, my unfavorable review had already been whitewashed from the airbnb site. Now I know why all the reviews seem so positive - the negative ones come down the very next day.</p>

<p>I suggest staying away from this <a href="mailto:jodi@capacitor.org">Jodi Lomask</a>. Stay as far away as you can. Here is her info:</p>

<p>phone: 415-308-1952
The address is 645 Haight St 11, San Francisco, CA 94117.
email: jodi@capacitor.org</p>

<p>She will not deliver the keys, not call you back, and keep your money. Go to a hotel. Airbnb is a joke.</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<blockquote>We sincerely apologize that this reservation did not go as planned. As a result, we have issued a refund of your normally non-refundable Airbnb guest fees. The refund in the amount of $72 will return to your PayPal account immediately.</blockquote>


<p>So according to <strong>airbnb</strong> my ordeal was worth an 8% refund. Wow. I've heard that some people really like it but just know that if you get completely screwed by your host, you will have a horrible and slow experience with support where they will ultimately side with the other guy. You know, because you don't actually own a 'bnb' you just wanted to stay at one.</p>

<blockquote>In our estimation, operating by the terms of the pre-agreed cancellation policy is the fairest possible resolution for this situation.</blockquote>


<p>So if I arrive, and you aren't there to greet me, it's not your fault. It's mine.</p>
