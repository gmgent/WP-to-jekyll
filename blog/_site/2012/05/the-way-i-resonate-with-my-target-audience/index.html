<p>It's fascinating, the way you can target the presentation of your music these days. Granted, it is a small segment because I can't afford to bankroll a huge promotion but the results are pretty telling.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/marketing-screenshot.png"><img src="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/marketing-screenshot-300x158.png" alt="" title="marketing-screenshot" width="300" height="158" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1852" /></a></p>

<p>As long as I target correctly, I can achieve above 95% approval from my audience. Why does that matter? It means every marketing dollar I spend can be like a laser pinpointed on the listeners that will care the most.</p>

<p><strong>98 Users listened to the whole track, and of those Users, 2 Loved the track</strong></p>

<p>98 of 103 listened to the whole song. That is <em>95.15</em> percent of people who have never even heard of me will listen to a whole song of mine and accept me into their playlist.</p>

<p>Here are the similar artists:</p>

<p><strong>Iron &amp; Wine</strong>
<strong>Damien Rice</strong>
<strong>Elliott Smith</strong>
<strong>Nick Drake</strong>
<strong>David Gray</strong>
<strong>Ryan Adams</strong>
Mike Doughty
Joe Henry
Chris Whitley</p>

<p>with the top 6 (in bold) responsible for almost all of the matches.</p>

<p>Not a single person banned the track, which just means that the few who did not listen to the whole thing were still not averse to hearing it again.</p>

<p>I have seen this kind of success with a few of my songs, in terms of fitting into a certain genre well enough to have such great possibilities for a targeted audience. These results are from <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Krister+Axel" target="_blank"><strong>lastfm</strong></a>, but I think they could easily be reproduced anywhere that keeps track of listener preferences - places like <strong>Spotify</strong>, <strong>Pandora</strong>, and even <strong>iTunes</strong>.</p>
