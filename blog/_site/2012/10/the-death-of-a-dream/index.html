<p>this road that I have walked on all these years
does not exist. As if
the struggle was against nothing
shadows and easy promises
empty air and reflections
but no road to walk on.</p>

<p>this window I have stared through
for a full season of my life
has no purpose. There is nothing to see
on the other side, only
more of the same. It is not
as I imagined.</p>

<p>the only feeling I have
is that of drifting. Along
some corridor in my mind
that leads into soft madness
like a cloud of cotton
behind my nose</p>
