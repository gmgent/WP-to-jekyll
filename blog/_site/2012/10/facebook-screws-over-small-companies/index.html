<blockquote>When we started our small business Facebook was a great way to reach our customers, and stay connected. I gave a lot of credit to it helping us get off the ground. Then things just started changing. We promoted posts for a few months, and it just didn't cut it. The way we sold on FB in the past was by building relationships with our customersâ€¦not posting an add. Also those posts adds up FAST!!! At the end of the month it was a nice chunk of money. All the pictures people sent in, and funny ones I posted weren't seen because I can't pay for all of them. Our sales dropped drastically. There are so many pages out there, and budgets are different for everyone. I know that some are paying for every post to be promoted because they are all over my feed. the pages like non-profits, and rescues are no where to be found. I get that FB needs to make money, and I don't mind paying a monthly fee. This isn't working for us, or any of the other small companies I talked with.</blockquote>
