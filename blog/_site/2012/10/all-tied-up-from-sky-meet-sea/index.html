                All Tied Up from Sky Meet Sea
            </h2>
			<p><a href="http://kristeraxel.com/media/2012-kristeraxel-AllTiedUp.mp3">This</a> (All Tied Up) was recorded at THe Village Studios in Santa Monica, what a great session that was. I played all of the instruments except for Scotty added some drums and cajone. My wife loved this song after I assured her it was written about nothing specific.</p>

<hr />

<p>All tied up, nowhere left to go but down
you turn your world around
burning down the house
when everything goes south
you change your state
find a place to go away
and try to love again
choice is not a sin
when someone lets you in
I know you're hurt
I know you're hurt</p>

<p>we take what's good and we take what's right
we break our toys and don't think twice
we hold our breath and don't know why
but it's over, it's over
has it been so long since the day we were born
because I feel so much is all but gone
so I hold my head I don't look back
but it's over, it's over</p>

<p>it's over now, it's over now</p>

<p>All tied up and something in my head won't budge
I'm changing all my ways
I'm counting up the days
the ones we didn't hate
it's over now and so we say again - you're out
and someone else is in
we don't know where they've been
but choice is not a sin</p>

<p>we take what's good and we take what's right
we break our toys and don't think twice
we hold our breath and don't know why
but it's over, it's over
has it been so long since the day we were born
because I feel so much is all but gone
so I hold my head I don't look back
and it's over, it's over</p>

<p>it's over now, it's over now
it's over now, it's over now</p>
