<p><a href="http://kristeraxel.com/media/2012-kristeraxel-Somewhere.mp3">This</a> (Somewhere) was also recorded at the Village Studios in Santa Monica. Love that place. Horn part written by the amazing Bill Dowling. Somewhere - a very simple song that I think was produced beautifully (if I do say so myself).</p>

<p>You don't want to be
alone in a storm with me
you don't want to be
lost at sea with me</p>

<p>you might love me
you might care
you might need me
somewhere</p>

<p>you don't want to be
chasing stars with me
you don't want to be
hiding your heart from me</p>

<p>you might love me
you might care
you might need me
somewhere</p>

<p>somewhere, somewhere
you might need me somewhere</p>
