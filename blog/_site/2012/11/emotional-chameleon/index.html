                Emotional Chameleon
            </h2>
			<p class="teaser_info"><p>This is an idea I've had for a long time. Also, for the record this is my first post using markdown.</p><br />
<br />
<h2>this is my first post using markdown</h2><br />
<br />
<p>Now that I'm writing my posts on Jekyll, I can use markdown instead of putting inline html everywhere. Happy days. I don't know much about it yet but now I will.</p><br />
<br />
<h2>what the hell was I talking about</h2><br />
<br />
<p>I wrote a poem a few weeks ago and it seems to be sort of popular. That's what the robots tell me, anyway. It is a sad and desperate <a href="/2012/10/the-death-of-a-dream/">poem</a>, and it brings up a point that I think is interesting. Much like the the <a href="/2010/05/ask-culture-meets-guess-culture/">Ask vs Guess</a> controversy, I think there are clearly two sides. On the one side, we have emotional chameleons. People that for one reason or another have a certain facility in moving through emotional states and identifying with them, and on the other side are people who define themselves via a certain emotional rigidity. It's a classic case of the same things look very different from one side to the other.<br />
The chameleonic sees the classic as putting the eye of perception in the wrong place - the classic in turn views the chameleonic as having a wide personality spectrum to be accountable to, which makes them nervous. The chameleonic would like the classic to live more in the moment. The classic would like more consistency which can be inconsistent with spontaneity.<br />
So as a chameleonic I say - especially when I am writing - what will I be now? Sad me? Indignant me? Indie-power me? and I don't really worry about what it might mean to anyone else, because I am just stepping inside a costume. Why would you concern yourself with how you look inside a costume? That's not you, it's the clothing. Only the face is you.<br />
But the classic gets nervous because it feels heavy to them. There is a certain manufactured gravity that I think is the mark of a good poem, or a good anything, and it might make certain people uncomfortable.</p><br />
<br />
<h2>bottom line</h2><br />
<br />
<p>Chameleonics tend to get indignant and classics tend to get offended. This is and always will be, as far as I can tell. The important thing is to take it easy. I always use the example of Randy Newman, who is such a great songwriter and he puts on all kinds of crazy hats. Like writing from the point of view of a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nGw_vAnqPI">racist redneck</a>. No one get on his case for trying to explore that point of view. It's art after all.</p><br />
