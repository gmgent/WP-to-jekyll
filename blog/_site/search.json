has no purpose. There is nothing to see

more of the same. It is not

you don't want to be

you might care

chasing stars with me
you don't want to be
hiding your heart from me</p>

you might need me

<p>somewhere, somewhere
you might need me somewhere</p>

<hr />

<p>When I walked through the door
with the wine in my hands
and a smile on my face
like a child
the weekend would fade
but then something would change
and we'd be here
together again</p>

<p>I waited up
I shined the light
I found the truth
and I made it right</p>

<p>there's a place I believe
where the sky meets the sea
where we both can be free to hold on
and this place I can see
where we both need to be
is where the sky meets the sea and holds on
so baby hold on to me
where the sky meets the sea</p>

<p>this show must go on
because there's nothing so strong
as the force
of a billion desires
we lose everyone
to the bass and the drums
and the voices
that just feed the fire</p>

<p>I waited up
I shined the light
I found the truth
and I made it right</p>

<p>there's a place I believe
where the sky meets the sea
where we both can be free to hold on
and this place I can see
where we both need to be
is where the sky meets the sea and holds on
so baby hold on to me
where the sky meets the sea</p>

<p>when I walk through the door
with a hand in my hand
and a kiss from the girl
that I love
we never look back
at the broken down tracks
and the troubles
that we overcome</p>

<p>there's a place I believe
where the sky meets the sea
where we both can be free to hold on
so baby hold on
hold on
hold on
hold on to me
where the sky meets the sea</p>

<p>It is possible that <strong>Somewhere</strong> gets by the gatekeeper for admission into the Radio Paradise playlist. That would be groovy. They are notoriously picky, and it is a privately run internet radio so it is up to the opinion of only 2 people. I am by no means approved yet but at least a song is getting reviewed now. The previous 5 were 'sorried' immediately. Oh the cruel whim of whimsy!</p>

<p>Please support <a href="http://www.radioparadise.com/">Radio Paradise</a> because they are awesome.</p>
