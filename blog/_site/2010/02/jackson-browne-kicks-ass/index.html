<p>Last night a great thing happened, Joel Eckels put together an amazing benefit for Haiti relief. I think about 30 songwriters performed and the quality of artist was truly outstanding. I was honored to play two songs - the first was "Celebrate Tonight", linked here from my wedding:</p>

<p>and then both Mike Freas and Marlon Grace played with me on "I'm the Gun". When I got off stage, Jackson Browne gave me a compliment about my songs and I was stunned. I still am. Jackson played a really great song called "All Good Things Come To An End" and that was one of the best nights of my life.</p>
