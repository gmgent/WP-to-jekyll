<p>Precision in speech-based communications</p>


<p>I will start with a quote, which is ostensibly a technical communication. Sure it is from a &#039;message board&#039;, which is more or less an informal medium, but that does not mean that universal rules of logic will not apply. Besides, it is a work message board (Campfire), and is used extensively as a measure of our internal communications. I think at the root of it that all communications should and for the most part will be judged mainly in terms of how effective they are, and to a smaller extent in terms of the economy of effort involved with understanding them. So here&#039;s the quote:</p>


<p><b>"the fix that fixes the workflow tests no longer applies, so 2 of the 3 will still be broken - FYI"</b></p>


<p>This is from a small team of developers working together on a single code base, with a set of automated tests that are maintained collectively. The expectations here are as stated above, namely that the message be effective and succinct. What Is Being Said?, as well as How long Does It Take Me To Understand It? should be the two questions in mind when assessing the inherent value of this message.</p>


<p>What Is Being Said?</p>


<p>In essence, we have a simple logical statement here - premise, conclusion. This is so, so that is so. Let&#039;s examine the first part, the premise.</p>


<p><b>the fix that fixes the workflow tests no longer applies</b></p>


<p>There are many potential meanings here, which one might call an ambiguous premise. First, the word &#039;fix&#039; is used as both a subject and a verb, which is bad form. It would be better to replace one or the other with a valid synonym, just to avoid confusion. The &#039;fix that addresses the workflow tests&#039;, perhaps.<br />
Next, we can see that &#039;the workflow tests&#039; are referred to collectively, which is a mistake in specificity. The employee here knows very well that there are only 3 specific tests that are affected - the 3 that are mentioned in the conclusion - but they prefer to describe as little as possible, essentially missing two chances to actually specify them. Of course, brevity is king, but it would be as easy as saying the &#039;fix that addresses the drug_name workflow tests&#039; which is only one extra word but helps us get much closer to a specific and limited subject from which to subsequently draw a conclusion. Finally, the last glaring problem here is that the phrase &#039;no longer applies&#039; is badly worded because it implies another question, namely &#039;why does it no longer apply?&#039;. It is also interesting that the employee goes to a certain length to be non-explicit - vagueness also at the expense of brevity. Did the tests break? Is it true that the &#039;fix&#039; still &#039;fixes&#039; the tests, if it &#039;no longer applies&#039;? The premise itself borders on the nonsensical. Better to say &#039;the drug_name workflow tests are broken&#039;, or maybe &#039;the drug_name workflow tests are no longer needed&#039;, or &#039;the drug_name workflow tests need to be refactored&#039;. All 3 of those different scenarios are perhaps referenced by this statement but we don&#039;t know which.</p>


<p><b>so 2 of the 3 will still be broken - FYI</b><br />
Stemming from an ambiguous premise, this is hard to parse, but we can see a few simple problems with the form again.</p>


<p>First, &#039;2 of the 3&#039; - which three? Using &#039;the&#039; here implies that we know which 3 to which the speaker refers, but this is the first time we hear of that number. So, in essence the reader is forced to conclude that the number 3 refers to the collective statement about workflow tests in the premise, but that is by no means explicit and fails one or both our expectations, depending on how generous you are - either it communicates ineffectively AND takes more time than necessary to understand, or it just takes more time than necessary to understand.</p>


<p>And yet again, the phraseology &#039;will still be broken&#039; implies that we know already that they are broken and are being informed simply that they will remain so, another mistake in the reference chain, if you will. We were never actually told that anything was already broken - if you remember, we were told just that &#039;the fix...no longer applies&#039;, so this conclusion leaves us, among other things, wondering if we were supposed to have had some information in the premise that was never forthcoming.</p>


<p>So, to conclude, we have no conclusion. We are left with more questions than answers. As I just mentioned, we are not sure if we missed something in the premise; we don&#039;t know why whatever just happened only applies to &#039;2 of the 3&#039;; and we have absolutely no expectation for the future which is usually what statements like these are used for. We don&#039;t know if this is a surprise, if someone should be working on it or perhaps already is, if this is a temporary state that will resolve itself somehow; so the usage of FYI is both unfortunate and supremely ironic, because of all the thing we have here, information is not one of them.</p>


<p>So please - be specific. Every time someone misses the opportunity to communicate effectively the whole world gets a little bit dumber.</p>
