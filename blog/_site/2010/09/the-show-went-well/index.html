<p>Room 5 went well, thanks to everyone that came out.</p>


<p>Many thanks also to Joel Eckels and Chris Pierce as well as Mike Freas, who all made me feel right at home even though I've been out of commission for a while.</p>


<p>Anyway, as of October I will have a bit more free time, so I expect to redesign some of my web sites and finally get around to releasing <b>Pain &amp; Joy</b> properly.</p>


<p>Until then!</p>


<p>yours -</p>
