        <title>EVOR review of Sky Meet Sea</title>
        <link>2012/11/evor-review-of-sky-meet-sea</link>
        <description><p>I got my first review for Sky Meet Sea. 10 stars out of 10. He says I'm headed for his top 25 list for this year. Ain't that something.</p>

        <title>the death of a dream</title>
        <link>2012/10/the-death-of-a-dream</link>
        <description><p>this road that I have walked on all these years
does not exist. As if
the struggle was against nothing
shadows and easy promises
empty air and reflections
but no road to walk on.</p>

<p>this window I have stared through
for a full season of my life
has no purpose. There is nothing to see
on the other side, only
more of the same. It is not
as I imagined.</p>

<p>the only feeling I have
is that of drifting. Along
some corridor in my mind
that leads into soft madness
like a cloud of cotton
behind my nose</p>

        <description><p><a href="http://kristeraxel.com/media/2012-kristeraxel-SweetThing.mp3">This</a> (Sweet Thing) is my first single from the new album. I wrote it years ago but it only got produced for Sky Meet Sea so here it is finally. Buy the whole album at <a href="http://axelradio.com/album/sky-meet-sea">AxelRadio</a> for only $4.</p>

<p>Produced by Krister Axel, mixed by Scotty Lund. Enjoy!</p>

        <title>Somewhere from Sky Meet Sea</title>
        <link>2012/10/somewhere-from-sky-meet-sea</link>
        <description><p><a href="http://kristeraxel.com/media/2012-kristeraxel-Somewhere.mp3">This</a> (Somewhere) was also recorded at the Village Studios in Santa Monica. Love that place. Horn part written by the amazing Bill Dowling. Somewhere - a very simple song that I think was produced beautifully (if I do say so myself).</p>

<hr />

<p>You don't want to be
alone in a storm with me
you don't want to be
lost at sea with me</p>

<p>you might love me
you might care
you might need me
somewhere</p>

<p>you don't want to be
chasing stars with me
you don't want to be
hiding your heart from me</p>

<p>you might love me
you might care
you might need me
somewhere</p>

<p>somewhere, somewhere
you might need me somewhere</p>

        <title>Sky Meet Sea album title track</title>
        <link>2012/10/sky-meet-sea-title-track</link>
        <description><p><a href="http://kristeraxel.com/media/2012-kristeraxel-SkyMeetSea.mp3">This</a> (Sky Meet Sea) is the title track from the album. I love how it turned out.</p>

<p>Added vocals by Lindsey Harper.</p>

<hr />

<p>When I walked through the door
with the wine in my hands
and a smile on my face
like a child
the weekend would fade
but then something would change
and we'd be here
together again</p>

<p>I waited up
I shined the light
I found the truth
and I made it right</p>

<p>there's a place I believe
where the sky meets the sea
where we both can be free to hold on
and this place I can see
where we both need to be
is where the sky meets the sea and holds on
so baby hold on to me
where the sky meets the sea</p>

<p>this show must go on
because there's nothing so strong
as the force
of a billion desires
we lose everyone
to the bass and the drums
and the voices
that just feed the fire</p>

<p>I waited up
I shined the light
I found the truth
and I made it right</p>

<p>there's a place I believe
where the sky meets the sea
where we both can be free to hold on
and this place I can see
where we both need to be
is where the sky meets the sea and holds on
so baby hold on to me
where the sky meets the sea</p>

<p>when I walk through the door
with a hand in my hand
and a kiss from the girl
that I love
we never look back
at the broken down tracks
and the troubles
that we overcome</p>

<p>there's a place I believe
where the sky meets the sea
where we both can be free to hold on
so baby hold on
hold on
hold on
hold on to me
where the sky meets the sea</p>

<p>It is possible that <strong>Somewhere</strong> gets by the gatekeeper for admission into the Radio Paradise playlist. That would be groovy. They are notoriously picky, and it is a privately run internet radio so it is up to the opinion of only 2 people. I am by no means approved yet but at least a song is getting reviewed now. The previous 5 were 'sorried' immediately. Oh the cruel whim of whimsy!</p>

<p>Please support <a href="http://www.radioparadise.com/">Radio Paradise</a> because they are awesome.</p>

        <title>All Tied Up from Sky Meet Sea</title>
        <link>2012/10/all-tied-up-from-sky-meet-sea</link>
        <description><p><a href="http://kristeraxel.com/media/2012-kristeraxel-AllTiedUp.mp3">This</a> (All Tied Up) was recorded at THe Village Studios in Santa Monica, what a great session that was. I played all of the instruments except for Scotty added some drums and cajone. My wife loved this song after I assured her it was written about nothing specific.</p>

<hr />

<p>All tied up, nowhere left to go but down
you turn your world around
burning down the house
when everything goes south
you change your state
find a place to go away
and try to love again
choice is not a sin
when someone lets you in
I know you're hurt
I know you're hurt</p>

<p>we take what's good and we take what's right
we break our toys and don't think twice
we hold our breath and don't know why
but it's over, it's over
has it been so long since the day we were born
because I feel so much is all but gone
so I hold my head I don't look back
but it's over, it's over</p>

<p>it's over now, it's over now</p>

<p>All tied up and something in my head won't budge
I'm changing all my ways
I'm counting up the days
the ones we didn't hate
it's over now and so we say again - you're out
and someone else is in
we don't know where they've been
but choice is not a sin</p>

<p>we take what's good and we take what's right
we break our toys and don't think twice
we hold our breath and don't know why
but it's over, it's over
has it been so long since the day we were born
because I feel so much is all but gone
so I hold my head I don't look back
and it's over, it's over</p>

<p>it's over now, it's over now
it's over now, it's over now</p>

        <description><p><a href="http://kristeraxel.com/media/2012-kristeraxel-Tragic.mp3">This</a> (Tragic) is one of the first recordings I ever did in Los Angeles. Those were great days, Sally Jaye and Joel Eckels, Carson Cohen and Adam Marcello, and yours truly. Recorded in 2002 I think.</p>

        <title>Facebook screws over small companies</title>
        <link>2012/10/facebook-screws-over-small-companies</link>
        <description><p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/10/3/3449542/facebook-promoted-posts">This is from a post</a> over at <a href="http://www.theverge.com">The Verge</a>:</p>

<blockquote>When we started our small business Facebook was a great way to reach our customers, and stay connected. I gave a lot of credit to it helping us get off the ground. Then things just started changing. We promoted posts for a few months, and it just didn't cut it. The way we sold on FB in the past was by building relationships with our customers…not posting an add. Also those posts adds up FAST!!! At the end of the month it was a nice chunk of money. All the pictures people sent in, and funny ones I posted weren't seen because I can't pay for all of them. Our sales dropped drastically. There are so many pages out there, and budgets are different for everyone. I know that some are paying for every post to be promoted because they are all over my feed. the pages like non-profits, and rescues are no where to be found. I get that FB needs to make money, and I don't mind paying a monthly fee. This isn't working for us, or any of the other small companies I talked with.</blockquote>

        <title>Sky Meet Sea track one free download of Sweet Thing</title>
        <link>2012/08/sky-meet-sea-track-one-free-download-of-sweet-thing</link>
        <description><p>download the track <a href="http://kristeraxel.com/media/m/kristeraxel-SweetThing.mp3">here</a> by subscribing to the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/rockstaralley-roots-music/id269041792?mt=2">podcast</a>.</p>

<p>Sweet Thing</p>

<p>I was the revolution
you were the liberation
that falls from a pregnant sky
set loose on a Friday night
I know what you do to me
you give love in these little pieces
saving for a rainy day
I think you should give it away</p>

<p>Sweet thing, sweet thing
all you get is nothing
sweet thing, sweet thing
all you get is nothing when you put nothing in</p>

<p>she's high on the running away
here tonight and gone the next day
sweet like a candy girl
lasts as long as a dirty word
soft like a butterfly
hot like a brushfire
don't make me fall in love
if you don't want to be the one</p>

<p>Sweet thing, sweet thing
all you get is nothing</p>

<p>Yeah, yeah and you're feeling so much better
you're feeling so much better
Yeah, yeah and you're feeling so much better
you're feeling so much better</p>

<p>Sweet thing, sweet thing
all you get is nothing
sweet thing, sweet thing
all you get is nothing when you put nothing in</p>

        <title>looking for singers who love children</title>
        <link>2012/08/looking-for-singers-who-love-children</link>
        <description><p>I have to say, this is a very interesting and original request. I have an old work acquaintance who contacted me and is putting on a show <em>a la</em> Jackson 5. He is a jazz lover and a detail-oriented person, which is why I think this is worth asking around. Apparently he had two singers already lined up but they didn't show up to practice and just pulled out of the project. The last I heard from him, we met up for a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charnett_Moffett">Charnett Moffett</a> show at the Catalina club, and now he is essentially MDing a show for his children and some family friends. They have been practicing for this show since May and need some vocalists to round out their sound.</p>

<p>He is willing to pay $250 per head, which includes the performance and 2-3 practices. He needs one male and one female singer.</p>

<p>If you are interested <a href="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/contact/">contact me</a> immediately and I will put you in touch with Michael.</p>

<p>Details:</p>

<blockquote>We have  a band with my two sons, Miles (17), Max (5), and friends: Nikole (8),  Caren (21+), Roy (21+), Eric (21+).
Max will be playing Drums, Guitar, and Violin.  Nikole will be singing on three songs (soloing on Lotus Flower). 

The show is primarily an opportunity for my sons to play together, Miles lives in Japan most of the year so they haven't 
had an opportunity to play together before.   Miles has been playing guitar, bass, and piano for about four years. Max
has been playing drums & percussion & violin for about three years and guitar for about two years.

As most of them are instrumentalists, it would be good to have vocalists so the music is much more interesting.

We would have two rehearsals on Sunday August 5th, Sunday August 12, both at 3:00p.m. in Pasadena.
And one rehearsal on Saturday August 18th at 11:00 am (most likely, still TBD).


The website for the August 19th performance is here:

    <a href="http://www.vanguardtheband.com/" title="www.vanguardtheband.com">http://www.vanguardtheband.com/</a> 

The working title of the  band is:  "Vanguard"
We're only expecting one show at this time.

<p>This is one of the best quarters I've had yet and is just distribution revenue, which is mainly paid downloads and streaming. I also get little bumps for both the sync revenue and writer/publishing royalties, so this is starting to add up to more than just peanuts. I think I may be looking an actual Snickers bar.</p>

Ode to a Seagull at the Diver's Cliff in Saint Tropez

To grow wings, and push myself
through the soft pudding that is
air, in smooth slices falling away
to the left where there are mountains
set like the folds of a whale's fat belly

To dive, and glide along the shore
just above the rocks
to strike a fresh path
with every flight
and touch the earth, the way a child
first touches fire...

I have seen men jump, at night they
drag torches with them but cannot
fly the air feeds the flame
and is too thin
to hold them,

they fall like shadows

  - March 1996

        <title>Mademoiselle de la Dance</title>
        <link>2012/07/mademoiselle-de-la-dance</link>
        <description><p>I wrote this for my senior Poetry thesis in college quite some time ago. I am happy to have found it, and I have my mother to thank for that. She keeps everything!</p>

<p>This is a 'Canzone', which is a very strict rhyme scheme of five 12-line stanzas, and a closer stanza of 5 lines for a total of 65 lines across 6 stanzas. Every line ends with one of 5 words that you choose very carefully. I took my five from a snippet by my favorite poet <strong>e.e. cummings</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/pride-and-other-long-shadows.jpg"><img src="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/pride-and-other-long-shadows-231x300.jpg" alt="" title="pride-and-other-long-shadows" width="231" height="300" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1946" /></a></p>

<p><em>Mademoiselle de la Dance</em></p>

<pre>
<em>some or if where
shall breath a new
(silverly rare
goldenly so)
moon,she is you

    - e. e. cummings</em>
</pre>


<pre>
as if we stood nowhere,
time shall breathe
a spell: where
still happens quickly where
thoughts are so rare
and I don't know where
I put me, once where
everything is, somehow so
curious, quiet was (so)
the place where
I met you:
you

were a red falling leaf, you
had veins where
blood boils, hot you
were red you
wouldn't let me breathe
and I had you
dancing, dreaming you
are so beautiful and rare
it is rare
that I dance but with you
dancing is so
easy, I like it so

like a mad waltz... yet so
simple and you -
if love is fast, so
are you (the bullet) and so
am I (the flesh) where
pain can be so
painless, so
blood-happy I breathe
in, I live and breathe
still: so
I am not un-living, which is rare;
quite rare

when life is rare -
why is this so?
if life is rare
then you (rare,
precious you)
are as the white doe: rare
like a soft stone is rare
I want to trace with two fingers where
the air meets your skin, where
the smooth, rare
curve of your throat (your breath)
purrs - you breathe

and the oceans breathe;
a dried-up wave is not as rare
as you my stare crashes breath-
lessly against you, my breath
sits waiting so
quietly... a secret, stolen breath
waiting to breathe
I cannot but wish of you
want of you
waiting to breathe,
in a world where
time stopped counting where

you lead me everywhere
as you have hidden my breath
somewhere: a beauty of skill quite rare
(and seldomly so),
mademoiselle have you

        <title>the canzone</title>
        <link>2012/07/the-canzone</link>
        <description><p>When I was in Poetry school, we had to write a Canzone as part of the senior curriculum. I was just reminiscing about that in my mind and I realized that it is becoming a lost form. Petrarch had a very specific rhyme scheme for a Canzone, and it seems like people are forgetting that. The internets think it is just some loose italian folk poem, or something like that, but I assure you that at least in the school of Creative Writing in Madison in the 90's it was a very hardcore format. Writing a good Petrarchan canzone is like hitting a hole in one - it doesn't happen often and it should be celebrated. One day soon I will dig up the one I wrote for my senior thesis, but for now here is the form salvaged from <a href="http://www.poetrybase.info/forms/000/31.shtml">here</a>.</p>

<pre>
 
Origin:     
Italian

 
Schematic:      
The rhyme scheme is as follows:

abaacaaddaee
eaeebeeccedd
deddaddbbdee
cdcceccaacbb
bcbbdbbeebaa
aedcb
 
Rhythm/Stanza Length:       
12

 
Line/Poem Length:       
65

</pre>


<p>UPDATE: I found the canzone I wrote, view it <a href="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/2012/07/mademoiselle-de-la-dance/">here</a>.</p>

        <title>safari keyboard shortcut to enter url by hand</title>
        <link>2012/07/safari-keyboard-shortcut-to-enter-url-by-hand</link>
        <description><p>My old version of Safari used to default focus in the url bar when you open a new window. Now it defaults to google search which is super annoying. I am always entering urls by hand and very seldom run google searches compared to how often I am just trying to visit a page I already know about.</p>

<p>I can't find a fix for that, but there is good shortcut to put focus in the url bar where it belongs.</p>

<p>Open-Apple (Command) + L. The same shortcut works in Firefox.</p>

        <description><p><strong>Permission problems with SSH</strong></p>

<p>Ssh is very picky about permissions on the ~/.ssh directory and files. Sometimes you may do something to mess up these permissions. Run the following to fix most permissions problems. You may have to do this on both the remote host and local host.</p>

<pre>
    chmod 700 ~/.ssh
    chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    chmod 644 ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub  
    chmod 644 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    chmod 644 ~/.ssh/known_hosts
</pre>


<p>Also no directory above ~/.ssh can have 'group' or 'other' write permissions.</p>

        <title>running out of isrc codes</title>
        <link>2012/06/running-out-of-isrc-codes</link>
        <description><p>ISRC codes and other kinds of meta-information contained within songs allow us to track digital clone-copies across the infinite e-verse while keeping the related information consistent. The ISRC could be considered the primary key for each song and it consist of four codes for a total of 12 digits - country XX + identifier XXX + year XX + song number XXXXX.</p>

<p>What this means is that for a given country, you have 3 digits to play with (the identifier) before you run out of codes. The number here is just under 50 thousand:</p>

<pre>
      alphanumeric = 26 alphabetical characters + 10 digits (0-9).
 
      36 ^ 3 = 46,656
</pre>


<p>I'm lucky I applied for mine early enough to get a 'US' designation, it seems that all new applications are being assigned 'QM' which is the new stand-in for US because they ran out of codes.</p>

<p>Crazy!</p>

<p><a href="http://kristeraxel.com" title="Krister Axel" target="_blank">Krister Axel</a> and <a href="http://RockstarAlley.com" title="RockstarAlley" target="_blank">RockstarAlley</a> have the ISRC code: <strong>US Y3T</strong> and I suppose we were lucky to get it.</p>

<p>I get a little worried for the next generation of songwriters because some of things I had access to are going away. It's harder to get into Pandora, or listed in Wikipedia, and those are small things - but that's all there is. Small things. Now there are no more US ISRC codes.</p>

<p>What is the world coming to? :)</p>

<p>Anyway, here are the codes for the new album. The last song is possibly subject to change because I have changed my mind a few times already. I have a confirmed mastering session in July for Gavin Lurssen to master Sky Meet Sea, so needless to say I am very excited. This will be the first time my mastering engineer has a few Grammys under his belt.</p>

        <title>a proof of concept maze game for ipad made with codea</title>
        <link>2012/05/a-proof-of-concept-maze-game-for-ipad-made-with-codea</link>
        <description><br><br>


<p>I've been playing with <strong>Codea</strong>, a Lua-based iPad app that allows you to make your own iPad games. My game currently takes about 8 seconds to win, which is not much, but really I'm just messing around with things until I get the hang of it. I like Codea because Lua is a really simple scripting language with decidedly few curly brackets - thumbs up for that - and it ships with a bunch of sprites you can use. It's also pretty easy to get the Lua files off your iPad (using iExplore) for backup, and you can add your own png sprites by just putting them in a directory with a pinfo file and uploading them to your iPad. Sweet!</p>

        <title>the way I resonate with my target audience</title>
        <link>2012/05/the-way-i-resonate-with-my-target-audience</link>
        <description><p>It's fascinating, the way you can target the presentation of your music these days. Granted, it is a small segment because I can't afford to bankroll a huge promotion but the results are pretty telling.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/marketing-screenshot.png"><img src="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/marketing-screenshot-300x158.png" alt="" title="marketing-screenshot" width="300" height="158" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1852" /></a></p>

<p>As long as I target correctly, I can achieve above 95% approval from my audience. Why does that matter? It means every marketing dollar I spend can be like a laser pinpointed on the listeners that will care the most.</p>

<p><strong>98 Users listened to the whole track, and of those Users, 2 Loved the track</strong></p>

<p>98 of 103 listened to the whole song. That is <em>95.15</em> percent of people who have never even heard of me will listen to a whole song of mine and accept me into their playlist.</p>

<p>Here are the similar artists:</p>

<p><strong>Iron &amp; Wine</strong>
<strong>Damien Rice</strong>
<strong>Elliott Smith</strong>
<strong>Nick Drake</strong>
<strong>David Gray</strong>
<strong>Ryan Adams</strong>
Mike Doughty
Joe Henry
Chris Whitley</p>

<p>with the top 6 (in bold) responsible for almost all of the matches.</p>

<p>Not a single person banned the track, which just means that the few who did not listen to the whole thing were still not averse to hearing it again.</p>

<p>I have seen this kind of success with a few of my songs, in terms of fitting into a certain genre well enough to have such great possibilities for a targeted audience. These results are from <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Krister+Axel" target="_blank"><strong>lastfm</strong></a>, but I think they could easily be reproduced anywhere that keeps track of listener preferences - places like <strong>Spotify</strong>, <strong>Pandora</strong>, and even <strong>iTunes</strong>.</p>

        <description><p>So that previous link for <strong>East of Hollywood</strong> got messed up by Feedburner, so here it is again! To all my friends. Awesome guitar solo by Bart Ryan. High quality mp3 (at over 256k I believe).</p>

        <title>watch out for airbnb</title>
        <link>2012/04/watch-out-for-airbnb</link>
        <description><p>I tried out airbnb for a wedding this past weekend, and the verdict is in. I never got my keys, because the host wanted me to wait until 7:30pm to 'drop them off'; so I had nowhere to go, so I booked into another hotel. Now they tell me that 'In our estimation, operating by the terms of the pre-agreed cancellation policy is the fairest possible resolution for this situation.'</p>

<p>So if I show up at your place and you are not there to meet me, it's my fault you are not there. And you get to keep my money. Airbnb robbed me of $900. My wife was in tears and I cannot believe this company is allowed to just screw me over like that. I really have never been treated this badly, by anyone in the hospitality industry.</p>

<p>After checking with the Better Business Bureau, it turns out Airbnb gets a big fat well-deserved <strong><a href="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/2012/03/airbnb-consumer-review-ratings-at-f/">F</a></strong>. I am not surprised.</p>

<p>Here is what happened:</p>

<blockquote>airbnb: stay at this amazing loft in San Francisco!
</blockquote>




<blockquote>me: ok, I'll take it.
</blockquote>




<blockquote>airbnb: check-in is after 3pm.
</blockquote>




<blockquote>me: ok, I'll be there between 5p and 6p because my plane lands after 4pm;
</blockquote>




<blockquote>airbnb host person: I have a practice from 3:30p - 7p, so I will have to drop the keys off at 7:30p. Where will you be?
</blockquote>




<blockquote>me: uh, ok, I guess that is the only option (wondering why I'm just hearing about this)...
</blockquote>




<blockquote>airbnb host person: you can also come pick them yourself if you would like - 5 miles away from the host address.</blockquote>




<blockquote>me: I don't have a car.</blockquote>




<blockquote>airbnb host person: no answer.
</blockquote>


<p>And that was it. I called <a href="http://www.airbnb.com/">airbnb</a> support and they called her, and that whole day before I landed at 4pm it was only radio silence. I landed at SFO knowing two things - that I had not heard from <a href="http://www.airbnb.com/">airbnb</a> or the host, and that the host was in a practice 5 miles away from where I was going and had no interest in helping me before 7:30pm. So I did what any reasonable person would do, I rebooked somewhere else. Now I have been forced to turn to the <a href="https://goldengate.app.bbb.org/complaint/view/57223227/c/w3y78z">Better Business Bureau</a> to at least have a forum for my complaint. By the next day, my unfavorable review had already been whitewashed from the airbnb site. Now I know why all the reviews seem so positive - the negative ones come down the very next day.</p>

<p>I suggest staying away from this <a href="mailto:jodi@capacitor.org">Jodi Lomask</a>. Stay as far away as you can. Here is her info:</p>

<p>phone: 415-308-1952
The address is 645 Haight St 11, San Francisco, CA 94117.
email: jodi@capacitor.org</p>

<p>She will not deliver the keys, not call you back, and keep your money. Go to a hotel. Airbnb is a joke.</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<blockquote>We sincerely apologize that this reservation did not go as planned. As a result, we have issued a refund of your normally non-refundable Airbnb guest fees. The refund in the amount of $72 will return to your PayPal account immediately.</blockquote>


<p>So according to <strong>airbnb</strong> my ordeal was worth an 8% refund. Wow. I've heard that some people really like it but just know that if you get completely screwed by your host, you will have a horrible and slow experience with support where they will ultimately side with the other guy. You know, because you don't actually own a 'bnb' you just wanted to stay at one.</p>

<blockquote>In our estimation, operating by the terms of the pre-agreed cancellation policy is the fairest possible resolution for this situation.</blockquote>


<p>So if I arrive, and you aren't there to greet me, it's not your fault. It's mine.</p>

        <title>yeah right</title>
        <link>2012/04/yeah-right</link>
        <description><blockquote>According to an Orlando Sentinel story later confirmed by Sanford police, Zimmerman told authorities that after he briefly lost track of Martin, the teen approached him. After the two exchange words, Zimmerman said, he reached for his cell phone, and then Martin punched him in the nose. Zimmerman said Martin pinned him to the ground and began slamming his head into the sidewalk.</blockquote>


<p>Because any 17-year-old would want to put down the skittles, after having lost his pursuer, and re-engage the fat scary 28-year-old who had been chasing him by somehow pinning the much larger aggressor to the ground and slamming his head into the pavement. That makes about as much sense as the idea that if you were getting your head slammed into the pavement you would be somehow all better by the time you show up at the police station.</p>

        <title>WGU entrance essay</title>
        <link>2012/04/wgu-entrance-essay</link>
        <description><p>I'm going for another Bachelor's, this time a BS of Information Technology with an emphasis on databases. As part of a much larger initial assessment, I wrote this essay. The question was very broad - 'write about a challenge you have faced in your life and how you overcame it'.</p>

<blockquote>In answering this question, I think it is appropriate to talk about how I got started in the world of tech. Although I have had many challenges in my life, the one that seems most relevant in this context is the broad challenge I faced in moving from being a VBA developer in the late 90s to being the Ruby developer that I am now.
When I graduated from college in 1997, I knew in my heart that I was going to need a career. I led a very successful rock band in Madison in those days, and it was tempting to just continue on that path, and live on the road and out of a suitcase for the rest of my life. The first challenge I faced was deciding what it was that I really wanted. I had had many changes of residence throughout my childhood and I finally understood then that what I needed was stability. I needed to grow roots. I decided to follow the girl I loved to Los Angeles and make a career there. We packed up a U-Haul with furniture, clothes, and a dog and off we went.
The subsequent challenge I faced, aside from the general stranger-in-a-strange-land issues that are so common, was to find a viable career. I had a very short-lived run as an associate salesman at a music store on Santa Monica boulevard. That was not for me. I needed something artistic. I finally ended up as a temp in a very small employment office with only two other people, both headhunters. I was the only person with a technical mind, and it soon became necessary for me to set up the payroll system. By that I mean one day UPS showed up with a few boxes. A Unix system and a printer. It fell to me to understand the OS, hook up the monitor, connect the printer, data-enter all of the relevant information and start printing checks within a few days. My career path was born.
The subsequent years would see me move from position to position, learning a little bit about everything. I learned how deep of a language SQL can be from a woman named Livia who was a geologist by trade and worked at FOX; I cut my teeth spec-writing for Toyota.  One interview that stands out in my memory was for TBG, where although I know next to nothing about Oracle databases I bought a large technical book the night before the interview and crammed for it like I was back in college. There were 3 questions on that entrance exam, and one of them had to do with indexes and clustering which I had just read about. If I had not spent the night before studying, I might not have been hired and I would probably still be a temp somewhere.
There were many challenges I faced as part of the broader endeavor to find a career path for myself as a young professional. One was finding personal clarity about what I wanted out of life. Another was using circumstance to my benefit  and having the patience to build up my resume one temp position at a time. Finally, it never hurts to study up. I often think of a popular saying when I think about those years: 'fortune favors the bold'. In my case, it was more like 'fortune favors the prepared'.</blockquote>

        <title>Hollywood half marathon 2012</title>
        <link>2012/04/hollywood-half-marathon-2012</link>
        <description><p>We did it. We didn't train very much but still got through a pretty tough 13.1 miles. The starting line was at Universal city, we ran down Highland to Hollywood boulevard, all the way east to Vermont, and then retraced back up Highland and finished in Studio City. The last two miles were a serious problem for me. The hill was too much and I just cramped up completely.</p>

<p>Here are our times:</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Screen-shot-2012-04-08-at-1.30.06-PM.png"><img src="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Screen-shot-2012-04-08-at-1.30.06-PM-300x18.png" alt="" title="Screen shot 2012-04-08 at 1.30.06 PM" width="300" height="18" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1774" /></a></p>

<p>2 hours and 19 minutes on the nose for me, and for Lavinia just under 2 hours and 27 minutes. Not too shabby. We both wanted to beat 2.5 hours which we did.</p>

<p>Also my splits were pretty interesting, I was on my way to a pretty great time except that the last two miles just killed me. That was far and away the fastest 10 miles I have ever run and then that hill put me in my place. Ah well.</p>

<p>Sure, it was downhill, but I had a mile at 9 minutes, one at 8:10, and one at 8:30. For 3 consecutive miles, I was averaging 8 1/2 minute miles, which for me is pretty solid. Lavinia and I both had a great time. We love to run. A special shout-out to G-mama for taking care of the Moosh for us.</p>

        <title>final paragraph of the essay Lester Bangs wrote when Elvis died</title>
        <link>2012/04/final-paragraph-of-the-essay-lester-bangs-wrote-when-elvis-died</link>
        <description><p>Here's the final paragraph of the essay Lester Bangs wrote when Elvis died that Bruce quoted in his <a href="http://axel.me/9x" target="_blank">talk</a>.</p>

<p>"If love is truly going out of fashion, which I do not believe, then along with our nurtured indifference to each other will be an even more contemptuous indifference to each other's objects of reverence. I thought it was Iggy Stooge, you thought it was Joni Mitchell or whoever else seemed to speak for your own private, entirely circumscribed situation's many pains and few ecstasies. We will continue to fragment in this manner, because solipsism holds all the cards at present; it is a king whose domain engulfs even Elvis's. But I can guarantee you one thing; we will never agree on anything as we agreed on Elvis. So I won't bother saying goodbye to his corpse. I will say goodbye to you."</p>

        <description><p>I write poetry. I don't know why, nor do I know what it means. Poems fall out of me like sneezing.</p>

<blockquote>your limbs are the jealous fingers
of a mountain
clutching me. Encircling me
only so that I might tremble
inside the heart
of the earth.</blockquote>

        <title>those lying corporations</title>
        <link>2012/03/those-lying-corporations</link>
        <description><p>No regulation for business, hmm? Self-regulated is well-regulated, invisible hand and all of that....</p>

<p>Well, they do some really bad things. Here are some of the ways they manipulate findings to suit their limited interests:</p>

<blockquote>One way that corporations prevent negative information about their products from getting out is by harassing scientists and the journals that publish them. Here's how Monsanto did it:

Dr. Ingacio Chapela of the University of California-Berkeley and graduate student David Quist published an article in Nature showing that DNA from genetically modified corn was contaminating native Mexican corn. The research spurred immediate backlash. Nature received a number of letters to the editor, including several comments on the Internet from "Mary Murphy" and "Andura Smetacek" accusing the scientists of bias. The backlash prompted Nature to publish an editorial agreeing that the report should not have been published. However, investigators eventually discovered that the comments from Murphy and Smetacek originated with The Bivings Group, a public relations firm that specializes in online communications and had worked for Monstanto. Mary Murphy and Andura Smetacek were found to be fictional names.

Corporations also form front organizations to hide their efforts to undermine science. That's what happened when producers of unhealthy food got together to cast doubt on the FDA's recommended health guidelines:

The Center for Consumer Freedom is a nonprofit that targets dietary guidelines recommended by the FDA, other government agencies, medical associations, and consumer advocacy organizations. The center has run ads and owns a website that accuses government agencies of overregulation, and has published articles claiming to refute evidence that high salt intake and other dietary guidelines are based on inadequate science. The center was founded with a $600,000 grant from Philip Morris, but has also received funding from Cargill, National Steak and Poultry, Monsanto, Coca-Cola, and Sutter Home Winery.

Sometimes corporations just go for it and buy off legit organizations, as Coca Cola did when they appear to have paid dentists to stop saying kids shouldn't drink Coke:

In 2003, the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry accepted a $1 million donation from Coca-Cola. That year, the group claimed that "scientific evidence is certainly not clear on the exact role that soft drinks play in terms of children's oral disease." The statement directly contradicted the group's previous stance that "consumption of sugars in any beverage can be a significant factor…that contributes to the initiation and progression of dental caries."

Corporations can also unduly influence federal agencies, as ReGen did when they wanted their device approved for trials by the FDA, despite serious medical problems:

ReGen Biologics attempted to gain FDA approval for clinical trials of Menaflex, a device it developed to replace knee cartilage. After an FDA panel rejected the device, the company enlisted four members of Congress from its home state of New Jersey to influence the evaluation process. In December 2007, Senator Frank Lautenberg, Senator Robert Menendez, and Representative Steve Rothman wrote to FDA Commissioner Andrew von Eschenbach asking him to personally look into Menaflex. Soon thereafter, the commissioner met with ReGen executives and heeded the company's advice to have Dr. Daniel Shultz, head of the FDA's medical devices division, oversee a new review. The FDA fast-tracked and approved the product despite serious concerns from the scientific community.

If bribery doesn't work, you can always censor negative results, the way pharmaceutical company Boots did:

Boots commissioned Dr. Betty Dong, a scientist at the University of California-San Francisco, to test the effects of Synthroid, a replacement for thyroid hormone. Boots hoped to reveal that despite its high price, Synthroid was more effective than similar drugs. The company closely monitored the research, and when Dong found that the drug was no more effective than its competitors, instructed her not to publish the results. When she refused to comply, Boots threatened to sue. The company relented only after several years, during which consumers continued to pay for the costly product.

You can also try "refuting" scientific results with bad evidence, the way the formaldehyde industry did:

To counter a study that found that formaldehyde caused cancer in rats, a formaldehyde company commissioned its own study. That study-which found no association between the chemical and cancer-exposed only one-third the number of rats to formaldehyde for half as long as the original study. A formaldehyde association quickly publicized the results and argued before the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) that they indicated "no chronic health effects from exposure to the level of formaldehyde normally encountered in the home"

And then, if you're Pfizer, you can just generate as much favorable research as you like to bolster sales of a drug, despite your discovery that the drug increases risk of suicide:

From 1998 to 2007, Pfizer discreetly facilitated the publication of 15 case studies, six case reports, and nine letters to the editor to boost off-label use of Neurontin, a drug prescribed to treat seizures in people who have epilepsy and nerve pain. The number of patients taking the drug rose from 430,000 to 6 million, making it one of Pfizer's most profitable products. An investigation found that Pfizer had failed to publish negative results, selectively reported outcomes, and excluded specific patients from analysis. [Most importantly] Pfizer failed to note that the drug increased the risk of suicide.</blockquote>

        <title>tu quoque and the right wing ruse</title>
        <link>2012/03/tu-quoque-and-the-right-wing-ruse</link>
        <description><p><strong>tu quoque</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>(Latin for "you, too" or "you, also") or the appeal to hypocrisy, is a logical fallacy that attempts to discredit the opponent's position by asserting his failure to act consistently in accordance with that position; it attempts to show that a criticism or objection applies equally to the person making it. This dismisses someone's point of view based on criticism of the person's inconsistency, and not the position presented. Thus, it is a form of the ad hominem argument.</blockquote>


<p><strong>ruse</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>a wily subterfuge; an action or plan which is intended to deceive someone.</blockquote>


<p>As an example, here is a little exchange from the interwebs about so-called 'Slut-Gate'.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/tu-quoque.png"><img src="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/tu-quoque-253x300.png" alt="" title="tu-quoque" width="253" height="300" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1696" /></a></p>

<p><em>I apologize to America that the left, who specializes [sic] in throwing crass insults, can't take what they dish out.</em></p>

<p>This is it in a nutshell. Here is the angle: redirect the argument with a logical fallacy that circumvents the matter completely, and then proceed with a few unprovable statements:</p>

<p><em>political correctness is more important than dialogue</em></p>

<p>and finish up with some lies.</p>

<p>Calling someone a slut publicly is not 'dialogue'; political correctness, to my mind at least was always about terminology and a sort of collective awareness of our own multicultural and interpersonal sensitivities. This does fall somewhere squarely under the banner of misogyny but more importantly it just fails the basic test of human decency. Disrespect is disrespect.</p>

<p>The fact that both the <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2011/02/22/exclusive-militarys-persona-software-cost-millions-used-for-classified-social-media-activities/">military</a> and the private sector are pouring a lot of money every year into supporting 'anonymous voices' like this one here, is just as shameful as the hate speech of guys like Rush Limbaugh.</p>

<p>Those are some cluttered and wacky echo chambers out there, with a lot of manipulated consensus. I joke a little, and that is a very general statement, but the truth is that we don't know how big it is. All of that information is classified - but we do know that the national security budget is in the billions and there are plenty of think tanks out there with a lot of interest in manipulating public opinion.</p>

<p>It is so easy to redirect the conversation with a just a little bit of inflammatory hate speech, and I try to click through to view the profile of whoever it is when I see that stuff. Either they are 'anonymous' like the one I used an example, or they invariably just opened the account a month or two ago and they have a lot of comments on only a few blog posts. Our world is far more compassionate than the DOD and the oil lobby would have us believe. Ever since environmentalism met up with the cause of liberals there has been a systematic demonization of stinky hippies, tree-hugging liberals and really any sort of get-a-real-job artist types. It is not nice and it is not friendly. Here is a bad example:</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/liberals-are-not-humans.png"><img src="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/liberals-are-not-humans.png" alt="" title="liberals-are-not-humans" width="466" height="76" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1698" /></a></p>

<p>Is this what we have come to? Complete dehumanization of the other side? By my own argument, at worst this is nothing more than another false consensus but even as a page out of the playbook of these shadowy social media manipulators beholden to whatever corporate holy grail they may be it is some scary stuff.</p>

<p>UPDATE: also, the right wingers are just mean. <a href="http://axel.me/8o">Killing a cat and scrawling 'liberal' on it</a>? Show me one liberal nut job who would do something like that. The right wing is where crazies <em>live</em>.</p>

<p>There is no string split in MySQL. How sad. Here is how I used INSTR, SUBSTRING_INDEX and LEFT to pull month day and year out of the original date field which was in the YYYY-MM-DD format - which is my favorite because it orders chronologically.</p>

        <description><p>You should always check ratings before you book with someone new. As it turns out AIRBNB has a horrible track record. I think service is so important and I saw the signs from the beginning. Service was so lazy and unresponsive from the start so that later they could just do nothing because they didn't see anything. Buyer beware.</p>

        <title>the problem with literal theism</title>
        <link>2012/02/the-problem-with-literal-theism</link>
        <description><p><a href="http://axel.me/7s" title="the original article" target="_blank">link</a> to the original article from Slate - <strong>Did Early Christians Practice Birth Control?</strong></p>

<p>So it's late, I don't feel like sleeping, and reading the comments on this one makes me want to write about it. It's a hot topic, a sensitive one, and the linked article is a good read. I can relate a little to the plight of atheists within what is quickly becoming a Christian nation, and there are many conversations to be had on this topic but I am going to try and pinpoint this issue I have with Christian literalism. Of course, I don't have to pick on the Christians - to my knowledge, Muslim culture, Jewish culture, and I'm sure many other religions I am less aware of have some element of literal belief within their faith - but I don't think it is a stretch to say, especially in light of this article, that the large group of fundamentalist Christians in this country that all believe in a literal interpretation of the bible is a unique social and political situation. We are the only advanced country with this reality. So much so that Obama had to make a concession to the churches that would not offer contraception to their employees. As smart as it is a political move, I think it is a slippery slope and we already see that it has opened the door to making the right-wing ideologues wonder how much more they can demand. So much for separation of church and state.</p>

<p>Anyway here is what I wanted to talk about:</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/religion.png"><img src="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/religion.png" alt="" title="religion" width="522" height="286" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1654" /></a></p>

<p>It is a simple forum exchange between essentially two poles, we will call them Lefty and Abe. Of course Abe gets points for quoting <strong>Ferris Bueller</strong>, and essentially he is a likable guy who will go to any length to defend his belief system. Alternately, Lefty comes across a bit harsh but is making a salient point.</p>

<p>Before I continue, I want to mention something that this whole exchange reminded me of. Perhaps some of you remember the tsunami that hit Japan last year - there was a great story (I can't find the link right now) that told of some indigenous tribes in Japan - essentially fishermen - who saw the tsunami coming because they had a traditional song that warned of the sea levels near shore dropping quickly. Apparently, before the 'big wave', the waters recede like a super-fast low tide and these illiterate subsistence fishermen knew that because they have a song passed down through countless generations that talks about that very specifically.</p>

<p>That, to me, is the role of religion - which I guess is similar to the role of folklore and other vocal traditions - to pass along information from generation to generation. It doesn't have to be literal - those fishermen weren't concerned about who wrote the song, or when or if there had actually been a previous 'big wave', or anything nit-picky like that. They just sang their song every weekend and one day it came in handy.</p>

<p>Greek mythology was a lot like that, and Roman, and even Norse - those are the ones I know something about - and the angle was always the same. Address issues that man is concerned with: why the sun rises, where the seasons come from, etc.; and then wrap it in a myth that can live longer than anyone. Harvests, or medicine, or astrology, or marriage - little nuggets of the people's wisdom would become lodged in a parable about Zeus, or Cupid, or Freyja. The point was not that these figures were real in a literal sense, but that behind the veneer of fickle gods engaged in decidedly mortal pursuits was a pithy comment on the human condition. Advice, even. But never heavy-handed - the lesson was always 'ignore at your peril', as opposed to 'sign on or be excluded'.</p>

<p>Today, we have a grown man who is clearly genuine and sane and probably a nice guy to hang out with who is defending the literal truth of the entire bible, contradictions and all - cheerfully. No irony. No sign of cognitive dissonance whatsoever. I know this is nothing new, indeed we have millions of people like that in this country, but it is no less disturbing by virtue of its own ubiquity. I think everyone needs to take a moment to think about that. It's not just the 'dumb' people, as the harshest lefty critics would say, as Lefty himself might say. Very rational and very sane people somehow manage to find a way to put their theistic views completely aside from the rest of their belief system, and proceed through life with not a inkling that their own actions are in complete contradiction with their spiritual beliefs.</p>

<p>For example - many fundamentalists claim - quite seriously - that earth was made, by god, about 4,000 years ago. It says that in the bible, apparently, and that being the authoritative source, means that it must be true.</p>

<p>These very same people use coal-generated power, and cell-phones made with coltan, for example - both of which are products of an earth that is (correctly) 4 billion years old. You can't make coal in 4,000 years. It won't happen.</p>

<p>So here's the thing about essentially all of Christian dogma - it was created by politicians. I hate to break it to you. As exhibit number one, I submit to you the farce known as 'the holy trinity':</p>

<p>The whole concept of Jesus as 'deity' and most specifically the craziness that is the holy trinity (all 3 - holy ghost, the 'father' himself, and Jesus are different but equal manifestations of the divine) was specifically designed as a power-grab wedge issue. The holy trinity was meant to alienate the Hellenists and elevate what was at one point a minority group (the nascent Christians) to a position of control. It worked incredibly well - the Hellenists were ready to play ball and share power except as devout rationalists they just would not swallow the seriousness with which the Christians were selling this whole 3-beings-as-one concept. As polytheists, they were natural compromisers - there is plenty of room for your gods too - but then as now what was to become the Catholic church would settle for nothing less than complete domination.
Christians in the 3rd and 4th centuries were very much the Tea Party of their time, and Jesus was the 'gay marriage' or 'job-stealing-immigrant' problem of that time - meant to to alienate their political opponents into irrelevancy or subjugation at the same time that they pushed the whole concept that the Christian 'godhead' is more 'real' than other gods. At the time, that seemed like an absurd tenet to most people but over the last 1800 years everyone seems to have forgotten that the story of Jesus was either appropriated from other religions like Mithras or literally debated into existence from whole cloth at the councils of Nicaea.</p>

<p>Jesus was one of many influential prophets at the turn on the first millennium. 200+ years later, his story was appropriated for political purposes. Ironically, they use a greek word <em>homoousian</em> to describe the controversy that would in short order relegate the Hellenists to ancient history.</p>

<p>I have no problem with religion whatsoever. Just don't tell me it is literally true. It feels like a very small step from believing in the literal truth of the bible, to submitting that creationism should be taught in school. It's irresponsible, counter-productive, and straight-up gauche.</p>

        <title>getting windows 7 to play nice with a mac airport express</title>
        <link>2012/02/getting-windows-7-to-play-nice-with-a-mac-airport-express</link>
        <description><br><br>


<p>Something about iPv4 vs. 6 and correct DHCP authentication, I had a lot of trouble getting my windows 7 box to connect - via ethernet - to the Airport Express that I have 'extending' my mac-based network. The error message I kept getting was:</p>

<blockquote>"Local Area Connection" doesn't have a valid IP configuration</blockquote>


<p>I finally got it working:</p>

<blockquote>
1- unplug you LAN cable and wireless connection. Go to  "Ethernet Adapter local area connection 2" properties.<br>

2- select "Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)"<br>

3- press Properties button<br>

4- select "Use the following IP address:" option and set this ips:<br>

 IP=<strong>192.168.1.105</strong><br>

 subnet mask=<strong>255.255.255.0</strong><br>

default gateway = your router ip address such as <strong>192.168.1.1</strong><br>

5- from second section select "Use the following DNS server addresses:"<br>

set "PreferAlternate DNS server:" your router default ip, for example <strong>192.168.1.1</strong><br>

6-press ok and try to connect through lan then wireless<br>
</blockquote>


<p><strong>After those steps, I also had to click through for Windows to auto-fix the problem it found that DHCP was not enabled.</strong><br></p>

        <description><p>We only had 8 days, I had to actually work in the evenings for a few hours during the week - thank god for laptops - but we made quite a trip of it. Amsterdam, Paris, Rheims, Ay, Brussels, Bruges, and back home. We love Europe in the winter. Or the spring. Or Fall. Or whenever.</p>

        <title>thumbs up for express js and sideways for quo vadis</title>
        <link>2012/02/thumbs-up-for-express-js-and-sideways-for-quo-vadis</link>
        <description><br><br><p>


<p>I've just been checking out some stuff lately and have been dying to try out <a href="http://axel.me/5m" target="_blank">express.js</a>, which is built on the <a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">node.js</a> framework. It is easy to use, super fast, and very cool. I highly recommend it for a lightweight and snappy front-end.</p></p>

<p>
Also, I am finally making the jump to Rails 3.2, and for that reason am porting my entire <strong>gmgpulse</strong> app, complete with new auth layer and switching from prototype to jQuery. It's a lot of work but will pay many dividends. Essentially I am paying off some existing technical debt and moving the whole enterprise back into the black! I am trying out a very simple and effective auth gem called <a href="http://axel.me/7l" target="_blank">'quo_vadis'</a> but currently it has a problem with the 3.2 release so I am crossing my fingers that the guy who manages the gem will merge the pull request soon - it has already been fixed. I figure since I have about 30-60 days before it needs to work, I may be all right.
</p>




<p>
UPDATE: The gem owner has merged the pull request, and quo vadis is back to 100% functional with Rails 3.2 (as of gem v1.1.2). I give it a full thumbs up now as well - simple, straightforward, easy set up, everything you want in a simple password auth system. There is no support for outside services - FB, or google, or open id, etc. - but sometimes you don't need that and it just creates unneeded complexity.

        <title>strange delete syntax with join for mysql</title>
        <link>2011/12/strange-delete-syntax-with-join-for-mysql</link>
        <description><br/><br/>


<p>With MySQL 5, there are two rules if you need to join to another table in order to delete records from somewhere.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Rule 1: no aliases allowed. Refer only to tables as themselves - better hope the names aren't very long!</li>
        <li>Rule 2: specify table name from which to delete <em>before</em> the FROM clause. </li>
</ul>


<p>Like so:</p>

<pre>
  DELETE sales from sales
    JOIN retailers on sales.retailer_id = retailers.id
   WHERE retailers.merchant in ('Test Merchant', 
                                'Other merchants that should not be here')
</pre>

        <description><p>I thought I had this info somewhere, but I guess I don't. Lavinia beat me by about 14 minutes but to be fair she trained and I didn't. Also, the times listed are raw (no offset) and actually we didn't cross the start line until about minute 16. So Lavinia's time was just over 5:38 and I was around 5:52.</p>

<p>We both ran the <a href="http://www.honolulumarathon.org/" target="_blank">Honolulu marathon</a> just before Christmas in 2008.</p>

        <title>police brutality on campus</title>
        <link>2011/11/police-brutality-on-campus</link>
        <description><p>When I went to college, the security was minimal and I don't think pepper spray was in much use. Fast forward to today. Things are out of hand. You be the judge:</p>

<p>video from Berkeley: <a href="http://axel.me/64" target="_blank">http://axel.me/64</a></p>

<p>video from UC Davis: <a href="http://axel.me/65" target="_blank">http://axel.me/65</a></p>

<p>link to article about pepper spraying at UC Davis: <a href="http://axel.me/66" target="_blank">http://axel.me/66</a></p>

<p>And then this nugget from UC police Capt. Margo Bennett:</p>

<blockquote>"I understand that many students may not think that, but linking arms in a human chain when ordered to step aside is not a nonviolent protest."</blockquote>


<p>Unbelievable.</p>

        <title>Epigrams in programming</title>
        <link>2011/11/epigrams-in-programming</link>
        <description><br>


<p>An ode to Alan Perlis, <a href="http://www.cs.yale.edu/quotes.html" target="_blank">copied from Yale</a>:<br><br></p>

<ol>
<li>One man's constant is another man's variable.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>Functions delay binding; data structures induce binding. Moral: Structure data late in the programming process.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>Syntactic sugar causes cancer of the semicolon.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>Every program is a part of some other program and rarely fits.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>If a program manipulates a large amount of data, it does so in a small number of ways.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>Symmetry is a complexity-reducing concept (co-routines include subroutines); seek it everywhere.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>It is easier to write an incorrect program than understand a correct one.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>A programming language is low level when its programs require attention to the irrelevant.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>It is better to have 100 functions operate on one data structure than 10 functions on 10 data structures.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>Get into a rut early: Do the same process the same way. Accumulate idioms. Standardize. The only difference(!) between Shakespeare and you was the size of his idiom list - not the size of his vocabulary.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>If you have a procedure with ten parameters, you probably missed some.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>Recursion is the root of computation since it trades description for time.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>If two people write exactly the same program, each should be put into microcode and then they certainly won't be the same.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>In the long run every program becomes rococo - then rubble.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>Everything should be built top-down, except the first time.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>Every program has (at least) two purposes: the one for which it was written, and another for which it wasn't.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>If a listener nods his head when you're explaining your program, wake him up.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>A program without a loop and a structured variable isn't worth writing.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>A language that doesn't affect the way you think about programming, is not worth knowing.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>Wherever there is modularity there is the potential for misunderstanding: Hiding information implies a need to check communication.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>Optimization hinders evolution.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>A good system can't have a weak command language.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>To understand a program you must become both the machine and the program.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>Perhaps if we wrote programs from childhood on, as adults we'd be able to read them.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>One can only display complex information in the mind. Like seeing, movement or flow or alteration of view is more important than the static picture, no matter how lovely.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>There will always be things we wish to say in our programs that in all known languages can only be said poorly.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>Once you understand how to write a program get someone else to write it.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>Around computers it is difficult to find the correct unit of time to measure progress. Some cathedrals took a century to complete. Can you imagine the grandeur and scope of a program that would take as long?</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>For systems, the analogue of a face-lift is to add to the control graph an edge that creates a cycle, not just an additional node.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>In programming, everything we do is a special case of something more general -- and often we know it too quickly.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>Simplicity does not precede complexity, but follows it.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>Programmers are not to be measured by their ingenuity and their logic but by the completeness of their case analysis.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>The eleventh commandment was "Thou Shalt Compute" or "Thou Shalt Not Compute" - I forget which.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>The string is a stark data structure and everywhere it is passed there is much duplication of process. It is a perfect vehicle for hiding information.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>Everyone can be taught to sculpt: Michelangelo would have had to be taught not to. So it is with great programmers.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>The use of a program to prove the 4-color theorem will not change mathematics - it merely demonstrates that the theorem, a challenge for a century, is probably not important to mathematics.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>The most important computer is the one that rages in our skulls and ever seeks that satisfactory external emulator. The standarization of real computers would be a disaster - and so it probably won't happen.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>Structured Programming supports the law of the excluded muddle.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>Re graphics: A picture is worth 10K words - but only those to describe the picture. Hardly any sets of 10K words can be adequately described with pictures.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>There are two ways to write error-free programs; only the third one works.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>Some programming languages manage to absorb change, but withstand progress.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>You can measure a programmer's perspective by noting his attitude on the continuing vitality of FORTRAN.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>In software systems, it is often the early bird that makes the worm.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<p>44.Sometimes I think the only universal in the computing field is the fetch-execute cycle.</p>

<br>


<ol>
<li>The goal of computation is the emulation of our synthetic abilities, not the understanding of our analytic ones.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>Like punning, programming is a play on words.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>As Will Rogers would have said, "There is no such thing as a free variable."</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>The best book on programming for the layman is "Alice in Wonderland"; but that's because it's the best book on anything for the layman.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>Giving up on assembly language was the apple in our Garden of Eden: Languages whose use squanders machine cycles are sinful. The LISP machine now permits LISP programmers to abandon bra and fig-leaf.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>When we understand knowledge-based systems, it will be as before -- except our fingertips will have been singed.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>Bringing computers into the home won't change either one, but may revitalize the corner saloon.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>Systems have sub-systems and sub-systems have sub- systems and so on ad infinitum - which is why we're always starting over.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>So many good ideas are never heard from again once they embark in a voyage on the semantic gulf.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>Beware of the Turing tar-pit in which everything is possible but nothing of interest is easy.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>A LISP programmer knows the value of everything, but the cost of nothing.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>Software is under a constant tension. Being symbolic it is arbitrarily perfectible; but also it is arbitrarily changeable.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>It is easier to change the specification to fit the program than vice versa.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>Fools ignore complexity. Pragmatists suffer it. Some can avoid it. Geniuses remove it.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>In English every word can be verbed. Would that it were so in our programming languages.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>In seeking the unattainable, simplicity only gets in the way.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>In programming, as in everything else, to be in error is to be reborn.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>In computing, invariants are ephemeral.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>When we write programs that "learn", it turns out that we do and they don't.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>Often it is the means that justify the ends: Goals advance technique and technique survives even when goal structures crumble.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>Make no mistake about it: Computers process numbers - not symbols. We measure our understanding (and control) by the extent to which we can arithmetize an activity.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>Making something variable is easy. Controlling duration of constancy is the trick.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>Think of all the psychic energy expended in seeking a fundamental distinction between "algorithm" and "program".</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>If we believe in data structures, we must believe in independent (hence simultaneous) processing. For why else would we collect items within a structure? Why do we tolerate languages that give us the one without the other?</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>In a 5 year period we get one superb programming language. Only we can't control when the 5 year period will be.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>Over the centuries the Indians developed sign language for communicating phenomena of interest. Programmers from different tribes (FORTRAN, LISP, ALGOL, SNOBOL, etc.) could use one that doesn't require them to carry a blackboard on their ponies.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>Documentation is like term insurance: It satisfies because almost no one who subscribes to it depends on its benefits.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>An adequate bootstrap is a contradiction in terms.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>It is not a language's weakness but its strengths that control the gradient of its change: Alas, a language never escapes its embryonic sac.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>Is it possible that software is not like anything else, that it is meant to be discarded: that the whole point is to see it as a soap bubble?</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>Because of its vitality, the computing field is always in desperate need of new cliches: Banality soothes our nerves.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>It is the user who should parameterize procedures, not their creators.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>The cybernetic exchange between man, computer and algorithm is like a game of musical chairs: The frantic search for balance always leaves one of the three standing ill at ease.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>If your computer speaks English, it was probably made in Japan.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>A year spent in artificial intelligence is enough to make one believe in God.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>Prolonged contact with the computer turns mathematicians into clerks and vice versa.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>In computing, turning the obvious into the useful is a living definition of the word "frustration".</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>We are on the verge: Today our program proved Fermat's next-to-last theorem.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>What is the difference between a Turing machine and the modern computer? It's the same as that between Hillary's ascent of Everest and the establishment of a Hilton hotel on its peak.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>Motto for a research laboratory: What we work on today, others will first think of tomorrow.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>Though the Chinese should adore APL, it's FORTRAN they put their money on.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>We kid ourselves if we think that the ratio of procedure to data in an active data-base system can be made arbitrarily small or even kept small.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>We have the mini and the micro computer. In what semantic niche would the pico computer fall?</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>It is not the computer's fault that Maxwell's equations are not adequate to design the electric motor.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>One does not learn computing by using a hand calculator, but one can forget arithmetic.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>Computation has made the tree flower.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>The computer reminds one of Lon Chaney -- it is the machine of a thousand faces.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>The computer is the ultimate polluter: its feces are indistinguish- able from the food it produces.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>When someone says "I want a programming language in which I need only say what I wish done," give him a lollipop.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>Interfaces keep things tidy, but don't accelerate growth: Functions do.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>Don't have good ideas if you aren't willing to be responsible for them.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>Computers don't introduce order anywhere as much as they expose opportunities.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>When a professor insists computer science is X but not Y, have compassion for his graduate students.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>In computing, the mean time to failure keeps getting shorter.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>In man-machine symbiosis, it is man who must adjust: The machines can't.</li>
</ol>


<br>


<ol>
<li>We will never run out of things to program as long as there is a single program around.</li>
</ol>

<p>Klout seems to think I am influential on the topic of Georgia. I think that's funny.</p>

<p>Yes, I have a song called Georgia Rain that has been successful lately but that hardly makes me a topic influencer. You be the judge. Maybe this song <em>is</em> a hit in Georgia.</p>

<blockquote><small>trivia: This is one of the only songs in the Axel catalog where I am playing what amounts to lead electric guitar. I had that guitar custom made for me in Madison in the summer of 1996. It is a strat body with a Nuno Bettencourt neck by <em>Washburn</em>, lol. Ash body and maple neck, I think. It is my only true left-handed instrument (with a right-handed bridge). My acoustic is just a regular guitar that I play flipped over.</small></blockquote>

        <title>Yahoo geocoder is gone</title>
        <link>2011/11/yahoo-geocoder-is-gone</link>
        <description><br>


<p>Yahoo quietly discontinued it's geocoding feature in September. I kept getting 503 errors until I looked at the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/maps/" target="_blank">Yahoo developer maps page</a>. I wonder if they were just using google maps on the backend and couldn't afford the new pricing structure.</p>

<p>Bummer, because I used it for almost everything I do with calculating latitude and longitude values on the fly. I am now refactoring to use <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/faq.html" target="_blank">google maps</a> instead. One might argue that I should have done that to start with.<br></p>

        <title>Why I am still mad at my Playstation 3</title>
        <link>2011/11/why-i-am-still-mad-at-my-playstation-3</link>
        <description><p>It started out bad, I should say that from the start. Maybe those are the relationships that seem the most rewarding at first - like maybe if you try hard enough, you can fix it, and then you will have created your own happiness. For me, I bought a PS3 slim model when it came out, not because there was anything I wanted to play but because I was getting ready for <strong>The Agency</strong> to come out.</p>

<p>Note to people that do things in anticipation of other things: bad idea. That does not always work out - they kept on pushing back the release date and then they pulled the plug. My hopes were dashed. <strong>Dragon Age</strong> got boring really fast, and <strong>Borderlands</strong> did too. My dream of playing a worthy MMO on PS3 was turning to dust.</p>

<p>And then I discovered Hulu. They had a client for PS3. That is great, I said to myself. I can watch my favorite shows on the big screen instead of my laptop. Maybe this PS3 will be useful after all. Now of course we are talking about software, and I can't reasonably hold PS3 accountable for the performance of someone else's app. It turns out that the Hulu app for PS3 is really buggy and laggy and just makes you feel dirty for using it. Also, most of the shows on Hulu are not licensed for 'television', whatever that means. Don't we all just have monitors now? I'm disappointed, but that's not the fault of Sony, right?</p>

<p>Well, technically that's true, but as a company like Apple will tell you, it doesn't matter if it's not your fault. That's a big plus for a closed system because you get to actually control for quality. Who else is big on a closed system? Sony. You see where I'm going with this? Besides, there may very well have been some platform issues that contributed to the Hulu app fail for PS3. At this point we may never know - but I'm starting not to like Sony. The only thing that was definitely NOT their fault was the licensing issue - and I could have lived with that. Or even if they just had a decent browser that actually parses modern javascript, things would have been fine.</p>

<p>And THEN, there was the mother of all PR losses - <a href="http://axel.me/5b">Sonygate</a>, you could call it. I had a few accounts hijacked, nothing major happened to me - but it could have been really ugly. More than 70 million people were affected by this, and that is <strong>their</strong> number. The real number is probably higher. What bothered me the most was how long it took Sony to respond. I had no idea what was going on for close to a week (if I remember correctly), and that was time that my data could have used against me had I been unlucky. The story finally broke, and I ordered a new credit card like millions of others but sitting on their hands while figuring out how to spin the story did not endear Sony to me.</p>

<p>For now, there is a glorified dvd player with its HDMI cable already pilfered from it living in my house, disconnected, dusty and presumably bored.</p>

<p>Maybe a game will come along some day with the power to bring it back to life.</p>

        <title>where oh where is my sandbox</title>
        <link>2011/11/where-oh-where-is-my-sandbox</link>
        <description><p>It ain't easy being a <strong>Mac</strong> person.</p>

<p>First you have to find a good game, and then you have to figure out how to play it on your Mac. For example, I sort of got <strong>DDO</strong> to play on my Mac via Crossover, but it was buggy enough to be annoying and functional enough to be somewhat compelling which was not a good place to be. The short of it was that I could never really group up because there was a decent chance that my client would crash at any given moment. As anyone who has played <strong>DDO</strong> will tell you, you eventually need to group with people because of the strong requirements for specific classes - certain instances need a really good thief, for example - coupled with the really annoying need for other live players to coordinate opening certain doors together. An example:</p>

<blockquote>You stand here, I'll go into the other room, hit the switch that both closes the door that I just went through and then enables a switch for YOU to hit that will reopen the door for me!</blockquote>


<p>It's either an ingenious way to encourage grouping, or an insidious way to render your 'hirelings' more or less useless just when you need them. It depends who you ask. If you ask me, it's an annoying way of grinding your solo play to halt where you have to leave because you are SOL and are doomed to take a penalty whenever you come back. Sweet!</p>

<p>Still one of favorite sandbox titles to date is a little-appreciated gem from Steam called <strong>Tycoon City: New York</strong>. I really loved playing that game but it too was pretty buggy. You would have to save incessantly just on the off chance that the game would crash, and even then occasionally the save file itself would corrupt and you would be lucky if you could restart without having to do a poor man's reboot by yanking the plug out of the wall.</p>

<p>I have also been revisiting the <strong>Tropico</strong> series, lately release number 4. I'm still not sure if I liked 3 better because although they made some things better they took away some of the detail-oriented browsing of individual citizens. I feel like you used to 'know' your citizens better and were more encouraged to select them and follow them around in 3. Now, the AI is noticeably better - people actually find things that they are looking for, but it feels less personal. I like more detail, not less, and I think in some ways they caved to the '<em>derr, this is complicated</em>' crowd and dumbed the title down in some ways to make it more palatable. Good luck with that one, Kalypso.</p>

<p>All I want is a crafting community with a player-centric economy, decent solo play, player-built housing and good customization options for your avatar. I don't think that is too much to ask. So far, <a href="http://www.originsofmalu.com/" target="_blank">Origins of Malu</a> seems to be putting something along those lines together. I will be following along closely.</p>

        <title>my thoughts on mobile gaming for iPhone</title>
        <link>2011/11/my-thoughts-on-mobile-gaming-for-iphone</link>
        <description><p>I finally got an iPhone. I wouldn't dream of developing a Rails app on anything but a Mac, and I had an iPhone 3G a while back, but for the last 2 years I had a Droid phone that synced pretty well with my google account and only froze up the tiniest little bit every now and then. Now that I am actively drawing down my gmail account and moving back to a personal (aka private) email account, it made sense to move back to the iPhone and try out the awesome new camera. It is slightly annoying that you can't use the photo stream on your Mac until you upgrade to Lion (note to anyone like me that was excited for iCloud and the photo stream) and there is literally no way out of the box to get pictures off of your phone without it except by emailing them to yourself, one by one. But the good news is that there are a couple of apps that you can buy that will do that for you.</p>

<p>I am using <strong>PhotoSync</strong> to push pictures to my desktop, <strong>PhotoLoader</strong> to push pictures to Facebook, and <strong>Move2Plus</strong> to copy the facebook folders over to google plus. Good times.</p>

<p>Here is a short list of the few game titles I am enjoying:</p>

<ul>
<li>Scrabble</li>


<blockquote>This is a classic. I wish the music wasn't so horrible but so far it seems to be a pretty solid app. The UI is pretty slick and functional and it's easy to turn down the horrible music. There is also a stats section which is a nice touch and is something I wish Civ Rev had.</blockquote>

<li>Civ Rev</li>

<blockquote>This is easily my favorite title for PS3 (as Civilization Revolutions) so I was pretty happy to see it offered for iOS. A Halloween special at 99 cents, how do you say no to that? It is almost the exact same game, down to the technology tree and all of the different Wonders. The one issue I have in terms of gameplay is with the screen real estate, I wish it were easier to scroll around the map without inadvertently moving your soldiers around. It would be great if you could lock a solder to the city and not have to worry about it. I lost a city that way because I moved my army out by mistake and Napoleon just marched his ass right in there. I took it back the next round but not before he stole <em>literacy</em> from me. That was a dark day. I'll bet this title is great on an iPad because you would have so much room. The one thing that is missing that I loved from the PS3 version is keeping track of all your victories. I enjoyed systematically getting every victory under Warlord before moving on to Prince, for example, and you can't easily track that for iOS.
</blockquote>


<li>Carcassone</li>

<blockquote>
This is a weird one, but it gets under your skin. It takes a while to figure out what a good strategy is, but it is also sort of intuitive and once you get a taste of victory it is easy to become obsessed. It is a lot like chess in the sense that you need to think about all sorts of eventualities. If <strong>Scrabble</strong> is unappealing to the barely literate then <strong>Carcassone</strong> will be unpopular among those who do not premeditate or who think <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_philosophy" target="_blank">systems philosophy</a> is boring.</blockquote>
</ul>


<p>In the end, I do not do a lot of gaming on my phone but if I did these titles would keep me busy for a little while. Feel free to post any personal favorites in the comment section.</p>

        <title>the fizzbuzz problem</title>
        <link>2011/10/the-fizzbuzz-problem</link>
        <description><br>


<p>I got the idea to try this from <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/02/why-cant-programmers-program.html" target="_blank">this article</a> after reading <a href="http://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/" target="_blank">this article</a>.</p>

<p>I stumbled a little on the mod function, I thought you could write 'mod' instead of using the '%' operator. So it took me just under 4 minutes. Hopefully that puts me somewhere above the middle of the pack.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1325022.js?file=fizzbuzz.rb"></script>


<p>Also, for the record I built a directory for the script and made sure it ran correctly within those three minutes. I saw a guy who says he did it in C in 30 seconds, and I'm pretty sure he didn't compile or run it in that time. Cheater!</p>

        <title>Officer Cardona aka the punchy cop</title>
        <link>2011/10/officer-cardona-aka-the-punchy-cop</link>
        <description><p>You may have heard now about Officer Cardona the punchy NYPD officer.</p>

<p>On October 14th occupy.uslaw.com posted <a href="http://axel.me/4e">this</a>:</p>

<blockquote><em>Officer Cardona— known to Occupy Wall Street legal observers as the officer whose violent reach across a police line to grab a demonstrator by the neck is thought to have precipitated  officer Anthony Bologna's infamous Pepper Spray attack — is reported to have punched another demonstrator in the face this morning.</em></blockquote>

<p>You can see it online, there are <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=ows+punch&aq=f" target="_blank">plenty of Youtube versions</a>. It's amazing how documented this movement is. Just this week, we heard that <a href="http://axel.me/4f">mobile devices now outnumber people in the US</a>. I'm sure most of these devices have something resembling a camera and of course many of them probably also have some way to record video. No wonder many states are enacting laws that make taking video, photos, or audio of a police officer a crime. I would bet a lot of money that New York is trying pretty hard right now to ratchet up their existing law shielding police officers from video recordings. I have been <a href="http://axel.me/4g">saying it for years</a>: this is quickly becoming a police state. Does anyone remember the <a href="http://axel.me/4h">ongoing Posse Comitatus violation that started in 2008</a>? They announced it in the <a href="http://axel.me/4i">Army Times</a>, after all. This is a systemic problem and I think it is absolutely a corollary to the problems that we have now with the big banks. Any successful kleptocracy needs henchmen. There is a culture in media and government (both <a href="http://axel.me/4k">wholly owned subsidiaries of the corporations</a>) that protests like <strong>OccupyWallStreet</strong> are just full of hippies and <a href="http://axel.me/4j">'left-wing nutbars'</a> but somehow the Tea Party has nothing but legitimate concerns.</p>

<p>It's enough to make you feel a little crazy, like it's all slipping away and there is nothing to be done about it. I think that's why <strong>OccupyWallStreet</strong> is enjoying such widespread support - something the <a href=" http://axel.me/4">Tea Party</a> never had. Ever since Obama turned out to be such a disappointment, people have been waiting for somewhere to invest a little hope.</p>

<p>I have made donations at <a href="http://www.occupywallst.org/">occupywallst.org</a> and you should too. Anyone in the 99% - which is everyone, knowing how <a href="http://axel.me/4m" target="_blank">invisible the super-rich really are</a> - should get behind this movement. <strong>OccupyWallStreet</strong> is about putting some of the power back in the hands of the people, where it belongs. It's as simple as that.</p>

        <link>2011/10/revolver-the-band</link>
        <description><p>Ah the old days. I just found this picture of me from 2000. I was such a strapping young lad.</p>

<p>[caption id="attachment_1340" align="aligncenter" width="300" caption="Krister Axel"]<a href="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/krister.jpeg"><img src="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/krister.jpeg" alt="" title="krister" width="300" height="200" class="size-full wp-image-1340" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>Revolver was the first band I played with in Los Angeles. Those were some good years, I only got to LA in 1999 so this is just after I arrived. This pic might be from the Coach and Horses, if I remember correctly.</p>

        <title>the two stages of creativity</title>
        <link>2011/10/the-two-stages-of-creativity</link>
        <description><p>This is a reaction to a blog post by <a href="http://www.greggfraley.com/blog/?p=2204" target="_blank">Gregg Fraley</a>.</p>

<hr>


<p>This whole conversation reminds me of a Hemingway quote, which is:</p>

<p>'Write drunk. Edit sober.'</p>

<p>Of course I am not encouraging people to run out and start drinking, but the point I think here is that there are two very distinct stages to creativity. I agree it is a choice, but it is also a process that can be understood (to some degree).</p>

<p>Stage 1: let it flow. Write write write. Do NOT stand in your own way. Write as much as possible and NEVER self-censor. That is for stage 2. This is the creative muscle that needs to be exercised and to quote Voltaire: The perfect is the enemy of the good.</p>

<p>Stage 2: look at what you wrote as if someone else wrote it. Feel free to move back to stage 1 if you get a good idea. Remember that 99% will be not usable and that is as it should be. Another good concept (I don't know who said this first): Kill your darlings. That means that if there is one thing that you are REALLY excited about, it might be a good idea to get rid of it. Superstar tidbits tend to get in the way of the whole. Be honest with yourself.</p>

<p>Those two steps have served me well for 20+ years, and I got problems but a lack of creativity is not one of them. What tends to happen, I find, is that as you perfect this 2 step process, with the two steps so separated (flow versus scrutiny) your brain over time is actually able to do them simultaneously - and that is somewhere after your first 10,000 hours (read Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell for more on that). It is here that good things can occasionally just land on the page, fully realized. That is what people talk about when they say the song wrote itself. This has happened to me on many occasions and these are among my best works.</p>

<p>Lastly, remember that this is not about you, it's about what you are writing or creating. I have never once been able to consciously direct or insert meaning into anything. If you get good at step 2 you will find that often if not always the good stuff is not what you expected or wanted - it is the stuff that was NOT consciously created. It is the stuff that just happened along the way. That is why step 1 is so important - you will never know if it is good until AFTER you have finished it. So don't judge yourself until you have walked away for a moment and can move on to step 2.</p>

<p>Good luck everyone!</p>

<p>EDIT: apparently, this is the original 'kill your darlings' quote:</p>

<blockquote>Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch: 'Whenever you feel an impulse to perpetrate a piece of exceptionally fine writing, obey it - whole-heartedly - and delete it before sending your manuscripts to press. Murder your darlings'.</blockquote>


<p>Later this phrase became 'In writing, you must kill your darlings' which has been attributed to William Faulkner.</p>

        <title>Nathan Fowkes is awesome</title>
        <link>2011/10/nathan-fowkes-is-awesome</link>
        <description><p>I have a very specific image that I am looking for as the cover for <a href="http://skymeetsea.com" target="_blank">Sky Meet Sea</a> and I was hoping my sister could do it but she is too busy being a full-time mother. I started looking around for someone else to execute my vision and I stumbled onto the site for <a href="http://nathanfowkes-sketch.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Nathan Fowkes</a> who I think is absolutely amazing. I have asked him to help and I am hoping he says yes! His eye for color is truly stunning and because the image I want is a sunset with a lot of complex and subtle hues I know he could knock it out of the park.</p>

<p>I have had great luck with all of the wonderful people that have done cover art for me in the past, so let's hope my lucky streak continues. In any case, if you are not aware of <a href="http://nathanfowkes-sketch.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Nathan's work</a>, you should be. Spend 5 minutes looking at his blog and you will wish you were a graphic artist.</p>

        <description><br/>


<p><strong>If it were not for Steve:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>I would probably still be a Windows developer.</li>
  <li>My laptop would be a lot uglier.</li>
  <li>I would probably still have a cable TV subscription.</li>
  <li>I wouldn't love to hate iTunes so much.</li>
  <li>I wouldn't be tempted every day to buy an iPhone.</li>
  <li>I wouldn't be tempted every day to buy an iPad.</li>
  <li>The software development community would probably be very different and certainly for the worse.</li>
  <li><em>Finding Nemo</em> would never have made me cry.</li>
  <li>Today would not be such a sad day.</li>
</ul>


<p>Rest in peace, great man.<br></p>

        <title>jamming with John Popper</title>
        <link>2011/09/jamming-with-john-popper</link>
        <description><p>This is a great lesson in why one must google oneself every now and again. I do this somewhere between every month and every quarter - both to verify my own SEO efforts but also to eavesdrop on anyone who is posting stuff on the internets about me. Sometimes, you find new things that you don't expect. Like that one time I found a whole album of live shots from a <a href="http://axel.me/3r" target="_blank">Hotel Cafe show</a> that I forget even existed.</p>

<p>Today, at the top of page 27 of my google search for 'Krister Axel review', I found this.</p>

<p>[caption id="attachment_1289" align="aligncenter" width="300" caption="John Popper jams with Krister Axel"]<a href="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/JohnPopper_1240018778.jpg"><img src="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/JohnPopper_1240018778-300x225.jpg" alt="" title="JohnPopper_1240018778" width="300" height="225" class="size-medium wp-image-1289" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>Yup, that is a really great shot of me jamming with the one and only John Popper. This was taken at South by Southwest in Austin, Texas around March of 2006. I was performing a set at the <a href="http://www.one2onebar.com/" target="_blank">One-2-One bar</a> (love that place) and in the middle of <a href="http://axelradio.com/track/southern-girl" target="_blank">Southern Girl</a>, John Popper hears the music through the window, likes it, walks in, someone hands him a microphone and he jams along. The timing was priceless. He took my solo for me. :)</p>

<p>So as it turns out, my friends over at One-2-One must have taken the picture, and are using it as one of their <a href="http://www.reverbnation.com/page_object/page_object_photos/venue_89531" target="_blank">profile photos with ReverbNation</a>. Thankfully someone put my name in the caption and google found it. Awesome.</p>

        <title>do not fry the ghost</title>
        <link>2011/09/do-not-fry-the-ghost</link>
        <description><p><a href="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/chili.jpg"><img src="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/chili-300x256.jpg" alt="" title="chili" width="300" height="256" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1276" /></a></p>

<p>A fascinating discussion from Facebook. I heard about these peppers on Man vs. Food. Crazy. Also, I heard something from my wife about a guy she works with that did permanent damage to his stomach by eating these things.</p>

<blockquote>I have Ghost peppers growing in the garden. I looked them up on Wiki. Apparently in their native India, they are used to make hand grenades for crowd control. They also use them to make smoke bombs. And they smear them on fences to keep rouge [sic] elephants away. I've never grown weapons before. I'll don Kevlar and goggles come harvest time.</blockquote>




<blockquote>Pepper heat is measured in "Schoeville Units" [sic]. Tabasco sauce is approx 2,000-2,500 a habenero is around 20,000. A young, green Ghost is 600,000+, and a ripe red one is well over a million and a half. They're almost poison.</blockquote>


<p><strong>the punch line:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
This is 100% true. My son Aidan came back with some ghost chillis from a farmer's market. We didn't know how to cook them so we decided to fry them. Wrong move! All we did was turn the oil into an aerosole [sic] and essentially tear gassed our house. The pan we used had to be thrown out! The worst part, was no matter how much I washed my hands the traces of the oil was still on there and I had to take my contacts out. It was like I was pepper spraying my own eyes. One of the all time stupidest things I have ever done.</blockquote>

        <title>what should we listen to when you go</title>
        <link>2011/09/what-should-we-listen-to-when-you-go</link>
        <description><p>This is an important question. I am am the youngest in my generation and it seems that I am starting to get requests from people in my family for the song they want to be played at their funeral. Being the family musician and songwriter, it is fitting that I be tasked with putting playlists together when the people I love start moving up to heaven. Also, I plan on living forever so that way I'll be around.</p>

<p>So far, I've got a request for a Krister Axel song and a French folk song. May it be another hundred years before I have to honor any of these requests.</p>

        <description><p>That was a long time ago. I remember ordering PlayStation games, beer and cigarettes from Kozmo in Los Angeles. Such a great service, so far ahead of it's time. I cannot believe it has been 11 years since they closed their doors. They shut the company down early so as not to screw their employees out of a modest severance. Who would do that now?</p>

        <link>2011/08/wordpress-audio-player-plays-illuminate-the-sky</link>
        <description><p>My sister called me last night to announce that my music is on the Friday Night Lights DVD. I knew that already but it was still nice to hear about it. Here is one of the songs from that DVD. I need to test this audio plug-in.</p>

<p>Head over to <a href="http://axelradio.com/album/swexico" title="bandcamp" target="_blank">bandcamp</a> and download the whole album for free (or whatever you can afford) if you like it. It's one of my favorites. The song is <strong>Illuminate The Sky</strong> from the EP <em>Swexico</em>.</p>

<p><a href="Illuminate-the-Sky.mp3">link</a></p>

<p>This is the plug-in site: <a href="http://wpaudioplayer.com/" title="link">link</a></p>

<p>EDIT: lyrics added per Selia:</p>

<blockquote>
I woke up today and my voice was 
Older than my heart 
Which carries a new scar 
The image of a better place 
Let me see the earth dressed 
For the seasons 

Diamonds in the street 
Spotlights in the wild 
Tonight I watch an angel 
Shoot across the sky 
Illuminate the sky 

Even as my dreams run slowly 
Beneath this printed sunset 
They begin to die 
We replace the impossible 
With the same wicked fever 
That burned heaven to the ground 

Diamonds in the street 
Spotlights in the wild 
Tonight I watch an angel 
Illuminate the sky 
Shoot across the sky 

I opened up my veins 
Showed you what I believe 
I hope you never change 
I hope you never change 
I hope you will always shine 
I hope you never change 

The stars in your eyes 
Illuminate the sky

</blockquote>

        <title>first time in Strasbourg</title>
        <link>2011/08/first-time-in-strasbourg</link>
        <description><p>Strasbourg was a total hit. What a great city. We loved the old town, we loved all of the canals and the much lower prices. I even tried the must-have local specialty <em>choucroute</em> (sauerkraut) with '7 different types of meat' -- they do love their butchers over in Alsace -- and it was really good. Surprisingly so. The cathedral is amazing, and second only to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathedral_of_Our_Lady_(Antwerp)" target="_blank">cathedral in Antwerp</a> which still takes the prize for <a href="http://mostawesomestthingever.com/" target="_blank">most awesomest</a> in my humble opinion.</p>

<p>[caption id="attachment_1214" align="aligncenter" width="225" caption="outside the cathedral in Strasbourg"]<a href="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/DSC01702.jpg"><img src="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/DSC01702-225x300.jpg" alt="" title="outside the cathedral in Strasbourg" width="225" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-1214" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>The train station is big and sort of modern and there are a lot of good hotels right outside the station, which is nice.</p>

<p>The best part of Strasbourg has to be the bicycle paths. They are everywhere. It is a great feeling to just ride into the French countryside and follow signs to some random place for a beer. That was one of our best days in the whole trip.</p>

<p>We saw a really cool 'International High School' in old town Strasbourg. Right out of Harry Potter, it was. I would love for us to find a way to raise our kids here just so they could go to this school.</p>

        <title>Mont Saint Michel</title>
        <link>2011/08/mont-saint-michel</link>
        <description><p>On one of the rainy days we were staying in Saint Malo, we took a trip to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mont_Saint-Michel" title="Mont Saint Michel." target="_blank">Mont Saint Michel</a>. I remember taking a school trip there about 20 years ago but it was great to go back because I didn't remember much. What an amazing place. Too bad it was raining but we still had a blast. Highly recommended.</p>

        <title>Saint Germain Des Pres</title>
        <link>2011/07/saint-germain-des-pres</link>
        <description><p>On our visit to Europe this summer, we ended up in a hotel for the first time very close to Saint Michel, near Odeon in the Latin Quarter which was one of my main stomping grounds back in the late 80's. It was great to be there again, and although Paris is getting hit more and more with graffiti it still seems to be holding up reasonably well. The fountain at Saint Michel and the statue at Odeon seem not to have changed at all, which is comforting, and because we were actually staying in the <em>quartier</em> this time we had a chance to walk around a lot more and explore the region. That was how we stumbled into discovering Saint Germain Des Pres, which I had always heard about growing up in Paris but never knew exactly where it was. It is a very nice little neighborhood and we stopped to have some coffee at <a href="http://www.lesdeuxmagots.fr/histoire.php" target="_blank">Les Deux Magots</a> which apparently used to be a hangout for Verlaine and Rimbaud among others. Here is a little photo essay of the church and some of the places nearby. Our little hotel on rue Git-le-Coeur boasted having had Allen Ginsberg as a guest.</p>

        <title>The John Malkovich problem</title>
        <link>2011/06/the-john-malkovich-problem</link>
        <description><p>from <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/23/oblong-mezzanine/">this link</a> regarding the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/23/oblong-mezzanine/">mezzanine product</a> by <a href="http://oblong.com/">Oblong Industries</a>.</p>

<blockquote>Talking to Kramer and Underkoffler, you really get a sense of just how much thought was put into this system. For example, Underkoffler brings up the “John Malkovitch [sic] problem” (referring to the film Being John Malkovitch which has a scene in which everyone in the world is John Malkovitch). You don't want to capture a part of the screen being presented and end up re-presenting a piece of the presentation. Again, all of these kinds of things had to be solved on the backend and UI levels. Underkoffler says they've solved almost everything, but there's still work to do perfecting this future of computing.</blockquote>


<p>I love weird tech vernacular. Too bad TechCrunch can't spell Malkovich correctly.</p>

        <description><p>Maybe I get a little too excited about buying urls. It's possible that is it is not normal. In any case, I was able to purchase<strong> axel.me</strong> for a very reasonable sum, and I am very happy about it. I think about once we have children, little Axels as it were, that I can set up a subdomain for everyone... A happy little family of bloggers, maybe.</p>

<p>Also, one day my wife may thank me for making <strong>lavinia.axel.me</strong> available for her if she wants to use it for something.</p>

<p>I even think about setting up my own short link service. Why not?</p>

<p>Am I crazy?</p>

        <description><blockquote>copied from a book of mine in the long ago:</blockquote>


<p>if I could paint my heart for you right now
the colors would blind us both
 I am in mid-explosion and I can't help it
 afraid to push open the door to this new understanding 
Only now do I realize how far I have wandered
 what it will take to bring me back</p>

<p>  I am glad for you, such a beautiful image
 of young and deliberate passion
 time has not allowed you much failure 
that cleansing fire of regret
 your heart is as big as any canyon
 even as my feet begin to slip</p>

<p>if I could paint my heart for you
 an empty shell is all you would see
 Choosing from among these pretty cages
 I find strength because you are still so free
 I am in mid-explosion and I can't help it
 you are a flower blooming patiently</p>

        <title>setting up a MacBook Air 2011</title>
        <link>2011/06/setting-up-a-macbook-air-2011</link>
        <description><br>This was copied from <a href="http://www.frederico-araujo.com/2010/08/19/installing-rails-enviroment-on-snow-leopard-with-macports-mysql-and-modrails-passenger/">this great post</a> by Frederico Araujo, with some small modifications for my own use case.


<p>MacPorts is still a smart way to go, I tried Homebrew first and ended up in Ruby gem hell.</p>

<p>Also, read all the way to the bottom before you start (you may need to add wget via MacPorts before step 3).</p>

<div class="textcontent">
<h3>Requirements:</h3> 
<ul> 
<li> Snow Leopard 10.6.4 or greater</li> 
<li> Xcode 3.2.3, 2.4.1 or greater</li> 
<li> Admin privileges on your mac.</li> 
</ul> 
<h3>Software preliminary:</h3> 
<ul> 
<li> Mysql 5.1.49 (macports)</li> 
<li> Ruby 1.8.7 (macports)</li> 
<li> Rubygems (download)</li> 
</ul> 
<h3>1. Preparing System</h3> 
<p>If you are upgrading from Leopard to Snow Leopard, I recommend you delete your old installation.</p> 
<pre class="command">sudo rm -rf \
    /opt/local \
    /Applications/DarwinPorts \
    /Applications/MacPorts \
    /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.macports.* \
    /Library/Receipts/DarwinPorts*.pkg \
    /Library/Receipts/MacPorts*.pkg \
    /Library/StartupItems/DarwinPortsStartup \
    /Library/Tcl/darwinports1.0 \
    /Library/Tcl/macports1.0 \
    ~/.macports
</pre>
Note: I was setting up a new MacBook Air, so I didn't need to do this, but I left it here for reference.

<h4>1.1 Prepare PATH environment:</h4> 
<pre class="command">$vim ~/.bash_profile
</pre> 
<p>Edit your ~/.bash_profile file and add these 2 lines.<br /> 
Check if they are not there already.</p> 
<pre>export PATH=/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:$PATH
export MANPATH=/opt/local/share/man:$MANPATH
</pre> 
<h4>1.2 Download and Install Xcode</h4> 
<p><a href="http://developer.apple.com/technologies/xcode.html" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','developer.apple.com/technologies/xcode.html']);">http://developer.apple.com/technologies/xcode.html</a><p>
Here I used the XCode install from my Snow Leopard disc, the above link is from the original post. The link includes the XCode SDK, I think, so it's a bigger download (4gb) whereas the Snow Leopard XCode install is only 2.7gb which is all you need for just Rails stuff and with a smallish hard drive, every gb counts. Also, I did the install via driveshare from my other MacBook Pro.</p>
</p> 
<h4>1.3 Download Macports and install</h4> 
<p>Download Page: <a href="http://www.macports.org/install.php" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','www.macports.org/install.php']);">http://www.macports.org/install.php</a></p> 
<p>Download Direct Link: <a href="http://distfiles.macports.org/MacPorts/MacPorts-1.9.2-10.6-SnowLeopard.dmg" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','distfiles.macports.org/MacPorts/MacPorts-1.9.2-10.6-SnowLeopard.dmg']);">http://distfiles.macports.org/MacPorts/MacPorts-1.9.2-10.6-SnowLeopard.dmg</a></p> 
<p>You might use this guide for installing Macports:</p> 
<p>Full Install Guide: http://guide.macports.org/#installing</p> 
<h4>1.3.1 Update macports</h4> 
<pre class="command">sudo port -v selfupdate</pre> 
<h3>2. Mysql</h3> 
<h4>2.1 Install Mysql</h4> 
<pre class="command">sudo port -v install mysql5-server mysql5</pre> 
<h4>2.2 Make mysql autoload on startup</h4> 
<pre class="command">sudo port load mysql5-server
sudo -u mysql mysql_install_db5
</pre> 
<h3>3. Ruby, Rubygems, Rails, other gems</h3> 
<p>3.1 Install Ruby from macports</p> 
<pre class="command">sudo port -v install ruby</pre> 
<pre class="command">$ ruby -v
ruby 1.8.7 (2010-08-08 patchlevel 302) [x86_64-darwin10]
</pre> 
<h4>3.2 download rubygems from http://rubygems.org/pages/download</h4> 
<pre class="command">cd /tmp
wget http://production.cf.rubygems.org/rubygems/rubygems-1.3.7.tgz
tar xpf rubygems-1.3.7.tgz
cd rubygems-1.3.7
sudo ruby setup.rb
</pre> 
<h4>3.3 Install rails, rake, rspec etc.</h4> 
You may want a lot of other gems, I added xml-simple, fastercsv, calendar_helper, etc., so add gems as needed, especially the mysql gem which you will need - but do that as specified in the next step.
<pre class="command">sudo gem install rake rails ruby-debug</pre>
<h4>3.4 install mysql gem</h4> 
<pre class="command">sudo env ARCHFLAGS="-arch x86_64" gem install mysql -- \ 
--with-mysql-config=/opt/local/lib/mysql5/bin/mysql_config
</pre>

DO THIS BEFORE step 3:

I had to run
<pre>sudo port install wget</pre>

before I was able to get the RubyGems install package (wget does not ship with Snow Leopard).

Other things I had to do:
<p>I had to install git from a package <a href="http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/">here</a>.</p>

good luck!

        <title>past positive and future oriented</title>
        <link>2011/06/past-positive-and-future-oriented</link>
        <description><p>This is a reaction to an RSA Animate video called <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3oIiH7BLmg">The Secret Powers of Time</a> where:</p>

<blockquote>Professor Philip Zimbardo conveys how our individual perspectives of time affect our work, health and well-being...</blockquote>


<p>I would like to make the case that rationality dictates a hybrid philosophy. I think a combination of 'Past Positive' and future-oriented is the only logical choice.</p>

<p>Past Positive I think is necessary because it plays right into the most human of needs - the need to leave a lasting impression on the world. Call it an illusion if you will, ashes to ashes and all of that, but as a creative and an artist I know very well that most if not all artisanal pursuits deal with this - that we all want to create something that is worthy of immortality. If you are a painter, you want your art in a museum where it will live (presumably) beyond your own lifetime; if you are a songwriter you want your songs to be recorded by the next generation of artists, or for your own recordings to live on as a shining example of one's own time period; if you are a writer, you want your work (book, essay, screenplay) to reach an eminent status where it circles back around and influences young minds over and over again - Catcher in the Rye comes to mind, as a great example of that. What an impressive, infinite and immortal work that is. So I think living partially within the 'Past Positive' paradigm is essential to that sort of emphasis - to create, and to in a sense curate one's own archive of materials. Blogging feeds this need in a sense as well.</p>

<p>To be future-oriented is also important - as distinguished from the 'Transcendental Future' orientation - because as empiricism will suggest the best way to create a positive future is to be positive. Happiness begets smiling but so too does smiling beget happiness. As Gandhi said - 'we must be the change that we wish to see'. I think this is one of the most important truisms in our universe. Spiritually, future orientation is the only way to go - that is, if long-term health and happiness are important to you.</p>

<p>So, simply put, a rational and intelligent being will find a balance between these two time orientations. One might argue that a little present-hedonistic is not bad, but keep in mind - pleasures of the flesh are only meaningful when they are <em>additive</em>. Hedonism only positively affects happiness when it is used 'over the top', so to speak, where the structure for long-term happiness is already in place. For more on that see <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/martin_seligman_on_the_state_of_psychology.html">Martin Seligman on positive psychology</a>.</p>

<p>Also, see <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/mihaly_csikszentmihalyi_on_flow.html">Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi on flow</a> - I think flow is itself a hybrid present-hedonistic and future-oriented phenomenon.</p>

        <title>the story about the Bin Laden MLK quote</title>
        <link>2011/05/the-story-about-the-bin-laden-mlk-quote</link>
        <description><p>I saw a tweet about it from <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/ClaudeSuper">@ClaudeSuper<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/ClaudeSuper"></a> and I thought it was interesting. I've been seeing this quote moving around Facebook today and I should have realized it was becoming a national news item. The story is from <a href="http://mashable.com/2011/05/03/altered-mlk-quote/">Mashable</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Returning hate for hate multiplies hate, adding deeper darkness to a night already devoid of stars. Darkness cannot drive out darkness: only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate: only love can do that. Hate multiplies hate, violence multiplies violence, and toughness multiplies toughness in a descending spiral of destruction. So when Jesus says “Love your enemies,” he is setting forth a profound and ultimately inescapable admonition…. The chain reaction of evil — hate begetting hate, wars producing more wars — must be broken, or we shall be plunged into the dark abyss of annihilation.

- Martin Luther King</blockquote>


<p>A modified version of this quote has been going around Facebook:</p>

<blockquote><em>I mourn the loss of thousands of precious lives, but I will not rejoice in the death of one, not even an enemy.</em> Returning hate for hate multiplies hate, adding deeper darkness to a night already devoid of stars. Darkness cannot drive out darkness: only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate: only love can do that.</blockquote>


<p>The first sentence (in italics, added by me) was written by <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/jmadly/">Jessica Dovey</a>, and came to be included in a tweet by <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/pennjillette">@pennjillete</a> that quickly went viral. It was incorrectly attributed to MLK in it's entirety, although the first sentence was not his. I think the message is still an important one and I agree with the premise of both the entire quote from MLK as well as the modified one. The world needs love that is for sure.</p>

<p>UPDATE: interesting <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2011/05/03/propaganda_bin_laden/index.html">follow-up piece</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/ggreenwald/">@ggreenwald</a> on the media's role in spinning the story of bin Laden's killing - while possibly NOT holding a gun (he was unarmed), which is what the White House <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0511/54162.html">had said previously</a>.</p>

        <title>prawn for Rails</title>
        <link>2011/04/prawn-for-rails</link>
        <description><br/>


<p>I had a question from <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/rcstolle">@rcstolle</a> on how to use Prawn, so here is a short primer. There are two ways to go - Prawn gives a pretty good amount of control via the built-in methods, so if your layout is static enough you can just build a report with what amounts to something of a cursor. Somehow it feels vaguely like Crystal Reports for those dinosaurs like me who actually used to use that once upon a time.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/895622.js?file=printable_drug_record.rb"></script>


<p>You set the fill color, you build the table, you move to cursor down a few pixels, et cetera. Everything is pixel based and although it feels pretty solid, you don't get any CSS, you can't float anything, and in the end the use-cases are sort of limited. The other route is to use the grid-based option, which allows greater control and flexibility but also forces you to delve a little deeper into the Prawn object model. Here are some code samples to show how the Prawn::Document::Grid class can be used in practice.</p>

<p>Starting with the document class:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/938422.js?file=document.rb"></script>


<p>the page:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/938424.js?file=page.rb"></script>


<p>the section:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/938425.js?file=section.rb"></script>


<p>and the supporting classes:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/938421.js?file=gistfile1.rb"></script>




<script src="https://gist.github.com/938419.js?file=gistfile1.rb"></script>




<script src="https://gist.github.com/938418.js?file=gistfile1.rb"></script>


<p>which leans heavily on the <a href="http://corelib.rubyonrails.org/classes/Forwardable.html">Forwardable</a> module.</p>

<p>Here, although you are still working very much with pixel values, you also are specifying rows which can help with complex layouts. If you need some reference for the Prawn Grid module it is <a href="http://prawn.majesticseacreature.com/docs/0.11.1/Prawn/Document/Grid.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>So, the bottom line is that Prawn can handle whatever you throw at it. It is a very powerful tool and I don't know of anything that even comes close in terms of pure Ruby solutions to writing PDF reports.</p>

If you see this on your Rails-based Facebook app, try disabling 'protect_from_forgery' in your ApplicationController. Facebook uses signed_request that you can decode and use to verify that the request actually comes from Facebook, so protect_from_forgery is unnecessary for applications that are accessible through the facebook canvas only.</p>

<p>I was paying for a 'private' server. There is just no excuse for that. Thankfully I am almost done moving all of my sites and all of my data onto more reliable servers. I am now using <strong>Rackspace</strong>, <strong>Heroku</strong>, and <strong>Namecheap</strong> for my DNS and hosting needs, and <strong>theaxelvault.com</strong> soon <a href="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/2011/03/the-end-of-theaxelvault-com/">will be no more</a>.</p>

<p>See you later Dreamhost! Maybe one day you will get your act together.</p>

<p>Well, things are wrapping up for me this month - I am basically done moving all of my blog posts onto the <a href="http://blog.kristeraxel.com">new site</a>, and my plan to finally get away from the horrible service of <strong>Dreamhost</strong> is almost done. <strong>TheAxelVault.com</strong> was a Drupal site that I built almost 3 years ago, and I am sort of sad to see it go.</p>

<div align="center">
<a href="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/axelvault.png"><img src="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/axelvault-278x300.png" alt="" title="axelvault" width="278" height="300" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-960" /></a>
</div>


<p>My wife always loved the look of it, and I did too. The problem was that it didn't run very well on Dreamhost, despite my paying for a 'private' server - they really use the term loosely. And it was largely something that had seen its time come and go. I don't really know what is going on with <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a> these days - but I am now using <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a> which seems to fit my needs much better.</p>

<p>I had a lot of hits on that web site for a while from 2008 through 2010, but then I moved my music onto <a href="http://axelradio.com">BandCamp</a> and TheAxelVault lost its purpose. Soon enough it will only be a screenshot.</p>

<p>Let us take a moment to honor this relic from my past.</p>

        <title>an open letter to Matt Taibbi and Adam Weinstein</title>
        <link>2011/03/an-open-letter-to-matt-taibbi-and-adam-weinstein</link>
        <description><blockquote>UPDATE: I tweeted a link to this story to both of these journalists that were once people I looked up to, and was roundly ignored. For so-called progressives they were decidedly closed-minded. This, to me, is the main part of why our country is so sick. Despite the 'myth of the liberal media' perpetuated by Fox and others, the truth is that what passes as liberal journalism is barely centrist from a historical perspective. The fact that our government got away with the greatest feat of public deception of perhaps all time is a great source of shame for me and the discussion about 9/11 is non-existent. <strong>The only thing we know for sure is that were lied to about everything</strong>.</blockquote>


<p>Here is the original post:</p>

<hr>


<p>Dear Matt and Adam (two journalists that I respect very much) -</p>

<p>Both of you have shown me this week that you find it all right to ridicule 'truthers' on the basis of what could be called blood-in-the-water syndrome. I don't defend all or even most of what has been lumped together under this umbrella of the 'truther' movement, but I would expect the two of you to keep your critical thinking juices flowing for a little longer than you have. The fact is, although there is a real confluence of tinfoil-hat thinking within this group of 'truthers', there remains a core of people just like me who do not really pay much attention to people like Alex Jones, but who do have a problem with being lied to.</p>

<p>Now <strong>Matt</strong>, you of all people should know how disingenuous it can be for someone in a position like yours to make it seem like all that is similar is the same - in your <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/blogs/taibblog/truthers-fight-back-20110315">blog piece for Rolling Stone</a>, you refer to '9/11 Truthers' in a very insulting way:</p>

<blockquote>
Okay, so, predictably, the 9/11 Truthers came out of the woodwork kicking and screaming, after I compared them to my friend's brain-damaged dog. I know I said I would leave this stuff alone, but… I can't! It's just too maddening!</blockquote>


<p>First of all, in referring to all 'truthers' collectively, you might as well call all Christians Catholics. I know for a satirist like you, a big part of your stylistic approach to writing is precisely this sort of aggression, and frankly, when it is applied to Wall Street or the Tea Party I find it endearing. What bothers me about this is that these are your people, at least in some sense - there is some truth here, whether or not you want to see it. Again, there are some real fringe views that have unfortunately come under the 'truther' umbrella that I can't and will not vouch for - but the fact remains, we have clearly been lied to, and that should interest you. By your callous cheap-shot at an underappreciated quest by the few for political closure, you are undermining the causes that you purport to hold dear - namely the protection of the few against the many and the debunking of propaganda at all costs.</p>

<p><strong>Adam</strong> - I saw this <a href="http://twitter.com/AdamWeinstein/status/49292112130355200">tweet of yours</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Will I unfollow you for RTing some Alex Jones 9/11 truther bullshit? Why yes, yes I will. #EveryTime</blockquote>


<p>and I would make very much the same contention - that Alex Jones does not by any stretch of the imagination speak for the large group of people in this country that know that there is a story within the events of 9/11 that has not been told. You and Matt are by no means the only people that have made this mistake - but I single you out because you should know better. You have both been duped in some way into thinking negatively about something that should interest you - that's the only explanation I can come up with. That's what I mean by blood in the water - this meme that 'all truthers are crazy and have no salient point to make' is so prevalent that you have allowed yourselves to stop thinking critically. Please allow me to make a simple argument.</p>

<p>1 - Tower 7.</p>

<p>FEMA, in the <em>World Trade Center Building Performance Study</em>, Chapter 5, Section 6.2, referring to the "Probable Collapse Sequence" discussed in NPH 22 says that  it's own explanation for how WTC7 fell has only a "low probability of occurrence".</p>

<p>There is still no credible official explanation for why Tower 7 fell.</p>

<p>2 - Nano-thermite</p>

<p> Traces of nano-thermite have been found in 100% of the dust samples taken from ground zero. This is a smoking gun in terms of evidence of demolition at the site. These are not conspiracy-theory armchair historians muddying the water, this a respectable coalition of academics and scientists who have come this conclusion, and it deserves to be taken seriously. I copied the report pdf from www.benthamscience.com - <a href="http://kristeraxel.com/media/other/7TOCPJ-WorldTradeCenter.pdf">link</a></p>

<p>The simplest explanation is that we are being lied to. I make no claims about anything else - I don't know why they wanted Tower 7 to fall. I only know that we didn't get a credible explanation for how it happened.</p>

<p>I only ask that the two of you ask yourselves this question - do you ridicule 'truthers' because you have actually looked at this evidence and have deemed it baseless, or is there another explanation?</p>

<p>respectfully</p>

<p>Krister Axel</p>

        <title>And it's over just like that</title>
        <link>2011/03/and-its-over-just-like-that</link>
        <description><p>Now that I am not doing that many shows any more, I feel like each one means more - which is an illusion. Things are what they are and we infuse them with drama and emotion and we compare to things in our past and we wonder why no one sees anything the same way. It is quite a game we play with ourselves, making sense of the nonsensical.</p>

<p>I had fun tonight, I played my new songs, my gorgeous wife was there with some of our friends and I felt like I could just barely taste again the flavor of performance. It's a drug, an intoxicating drug of habit and mystery and fleeting moments of perfection. It is also very much my past, and I realize that playing on a stage will forever make me feel young. Where there is challenge and uncertainty, yet hope, there is a path out of the mundane - the raw creativity of songwriting is what saved my adolescent self from itself, but the slot-machine draw of performance is what saved my adult self from nihilism. That is where I decided to never again care what other people think, to rise and fall as the captain of my own ship, and to feel worthy of anything I could conceive. I owe my wonderful marriage to the confidence I found as a performer - and I found a purpose within the doctrine of musical performance, where for the most part people respect each other and we listen to each other. I've said it before and I'll say it again - I owe my life to music, to songwriting and improvisation. We are all our best selves on stage - partly because we are forced to smile at the camera, partly because we are forced to be optimists in the face of all kinds of adversity, partly because we are doing what we love - and at least in my case, it helps fight the misanthropic tendencies I have in my heart. :)</p>

<p>I made some new friends tonight. I was very happy that everyone was absolutely outstanding. Justine Bennett, B Willing James, Joel Eckels - they all had their personal thing going and my style fit right in.</p>

<p>I got some video from the performance, but the lighting was pretty bad so I'm not sure how useful it will be. In any case, the camera guy did a great job. Matt Renoir - I'm sure guys in his profession have a saying about you are only as good as your lighting. He did the best he could and was a great sport, we talked about doing some work together again very soon.</p>

<p>My take away from this was that I really need to book a full slot, I'm a big fan of Mondays at Room 5 but for me, I really wanted to play a few songs back to back. Next up - find somewhere with good sound and great lighting and do a full set. That way it will be worth it taking HD video of the performance. Clearly I have the right guy for it.</p>

        <title>They Were Always Teabaggers To Me</title>
        <link>2011/03/they-were-always-teabaggers-to-me</link>
        <description><h3>The Strange History of the Teabagger Movement</h3>


<p>This stuff is so rich. You really can't make it up - reality is so much stranger than fiction.</p>

<p>The first big day for this movement was February 27, 2009. It was the beginnings of the Tea Party, what was then a fringe group funded mainly by <a href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Americans_for_Prosperity">Americans for Prosperity</a> and <a href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Freedom_Works">Freedom Works</a>. There was a young man there with a sign.<br/>
<a href="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/d4cd01573a2f6874e5e5f5a547893163.jpg"><img src="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/d4cd01573a2f6874e5e5f5a547893163.jpg" alt="" title="d4cd01573a2f6874e5e5f5a547893163" width="382" height="284" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-804" /></a></p>

<p>The newly frescoed Tea Party was rearing up for a big protest on tax day - April 15th. In the run-up to that, Rachel Maddow <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLsKt4O4Yw8">had some fun</a> at their expense. This set off what can only be called a shit storm.<br/>
<a href="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Thank-You-Fox-News-for-Keeping-Us-Infromed.bmp"><img src="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Thank-You-Fox-News-for-Keeping-Us-Infromed.bmp" alt="" title="Thank-You-Fox-News-for-Keeping-Us-Infromed" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-805" /></a>
<a href="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Keep-the-Tea-Dump-the-Polititions.bmp"><img src="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Keep-the-Tea-Dump-the-Polititions.bmp" alt="" title="Keep-the-Tea-Dump-the-Polititions" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-806" /></a></p>

<p>All of which made for some pretty silly signage from the linguistically challenged right-wing base. But it gets better.</p>

<p>It's clear that somewhere within the eddies of spin and counter-spin, there was a real lack of homework done by whoever came up with the teabag idea in the first place. The amount of coverage it got was miraculous - and what was great is that you could see at the time that most of the talking heads had not gotten the memo about putting the kibosh on the term 'teabagger' - so it died a very slow death (at least in terms of modern media cycles) and the upshot was nothing short of hilarious.

<a href="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/prud-to-be-a-tea-bagger.png"><img src="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/prud-to-be-a-tea-bagger.png" alt="" title="prud-to-be-a-tea-bagger" width="387" height="428" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-810" /></a></p>

<p>It was like watching a car crash in slow motion. Even some of our congresspeople (like Phil Gingrey) got in on the action.<br/>
<a href="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/philgrigngey-.png"><img src="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/philgrigngey--300x287.png" alt="" title="philgrigngey-" width="300" height="287" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-811" /></a></p>

<p>Of course, within a few weeks of the Maddow piece the faux outrage and subsequent condemnation began in full force - a specialty of right-wing demagogues. The bullshit was flying fast and thick as the republican money machine was pulling all references to 'teabaggers' from the internets, and basically trying to make it look (as usual) like a liberal conspiracy. Within this time frame, there was a concerted effort to rebrand all teabaggers as 'tea partiers', and it was very effective. It was almost as if the original term had never existed. By the end of the year, redstate (a right wing blog) ran a piece that summed it up nicely.<br/></p>

<p><a href="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/redstate-20091110.png"><img src="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/redstate-20091110-504x1024.png" alt="" title="redstate-20091110" width="504" height="1024" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-813" /></a></p>

<p>The best part of all of this is that in the final end game, the right has come back around and is now again embracing the 'teabagger' meme. First it was on, then it was a liberal conspiracy, then their hand was forced and they had to take it back from the liberals, so it's on again - sort of a nonsensical narrative but that should not be surprising. Anyway, now you have guys like Breitbart trying to again lay claim to the term in a sort of those-liberals-can't-get-their-minds-out-of-the-gutter kind of way. I'm slightly hesitant to <a href="http://biggovernment.com/abreitbart/2010/04/14/im-proud-to-be-a-tea-bagger/">link</a> to the video, but it really is absolutely priceless. Here are some screenshots:</p>

<p>So that is the story of the term <strong>teabagger</strong> - first it had to do with a horribly repressive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_Act">import tax</a>, then 236 years went by, then it had to do with horribly naive demagoguery, then it was spun as a liberal conspiracy, and then it found its true place as a right wing meme.</p>

        <title>Propaganda victims R us</title>
        <link>2011/03/propaganda-victims-r-us</link>
        <description><p>We really have a problem here.</p>

<p>In the days of the Soviet Union, they had their State run news organs, Izvestia and Tass. These were pretty much propaganda organs, but they only had limited effect because the people knew it was propaganda. Today we here in the USA have a real problem on our hands because most people are inclined to think they aren't being lied to.</p>

<p>I can't tell you how often I see these memes popping up - someone spouting propaganda as truth because they heard it on Glenn Beck, or FOX News, or whatever. We have completely lost the ability to think for ourselves in this country. I pride myself in always being ready, or at least open, to changing my opinion in the light of new evidence because there is so much bad information out there. But some people really only listen to certain voices coming from certain places and the real irony here, which is pretty much par for the course around the country, is that this guy (mentioned below) is defending the 1% that he is surely not a part of with a tired internet meme that dates as far back as 2004.</p>

<p>It is explained <a href="http://www.truthorfiction.com/rumors/t/taxcuts.htm" target="_blank">here</a> that this silly analogy about how taxes are collected and why we shouldn't 'overtax the rich' - as if that is even remotely the case right now - has been attributed to two different economic 'scholars' neither of whom are taking credit for it. When I tried to explain the problems with his analogy I got this response which is really the heart of it:</p>

<blockquote>not my analogy, was written by T Davies professor of accounting and chair division of accounting and business law. University of south Dakota. Its not the Taxes that are unfair, its the wage disparity but thats the evil that comes with capitalism. Those who don't like it should go check out a socialist society, no one lives well or has any freedoms. The poor of this country still live better than 90% of the world</blockquote>


<p>There is this concept of 'inevitability of evil' - as if we have no control. And then I got this:</p>

<blockquote>
 give me an example of a country with more than 200 mil people to make a fair comparison. size does matter. As well, europe seems to have its economic problems as well. A huge sovereign debt crisis is looming. As well I am not sure if the social model you are referring to really is Viable. I do recall some violent riots in france just this past october. I did not say I thought our system was fair, my point is that you can not solve the problems by simply taxing the rich.
</blockquote>


<p>Anyway, here's the meme:</p>

<blockquote><i>
Let's put tax cuts in terms everyone can understand.  
Suppose that every  day, ten men go out for dinner. The bill for all ten comes to $100. If  they paid their bill the way we pay our taxes, it would go something like this:

 * The first four men (the poorest) would pay nothing.
 * The fifth would pay $1.
 * The sixth would pay $3.
 * The seventh $7.
 * The eighth $12.
 * The ninth $18.
 * The tenth man (the richest) would pay $59.

So, that's what they decided to do. The ten men ate dinner in the restaurant every day and seemed quite happy with the arrangement, until one day, the owner threw them a curve.

"Since you are all such good customers," he said, "I'm going to reduce the cost of your daily meal by $20."

So, now dinner for the ten only cost $80. The group still wanted to pay their bill the way we pay our taxes.

So, the first four men were unaffected. They would still eat for free. But what about the other six, the paying customers? How could they divvy up the $20 windfall so that everyone would get his 'fair share'?

The six men realized that $20 divided by six is $3.33. But if they subtracted that from everybody's share, then the
fifth man and the sixth man would each end up being 'PAID' to eat their meal.

So, the restaurant owner suggested that it would be fair to reduce each man's bill by roughly the same amount, and he proceeded to work out the amounts each should pay.

 And so:

 * The fifth man, like the first four, now paid nothing (100% savings).
 * The sixth now paid $2 instead of $3 (33% savings).
 * The seventh now paid $5 instead of $7 (28% savings).
 * The eighth now paid $9 instead of $12 (25% savings).
 * The ninth now paid $14 instead of $18 (22% savings).
 * The tenth now paid $49 instead of $59 (16% savings).

Each of the six was better off than before. And the first four continued to eat for free. But once outside the restaurant, the men began to compare their savings.

"I only got a dollar out of the $20," declared the sixth man. He pointed to the tenth man "but he got $10!"

"Yeah, that's right," exclaimed the fifth man. "I only saved a dollar, too. It's unfair that he got ten times more than me!"

"That's true!!" shouted the seventh man. "Why should he get $10 back when I got only $2? The wealthy get all the breaks!"


"Wait a minute," yelled the first four men in unison. "We didn't get anything at all. The system exploits the poor!"

The nine men surrounded the tenth and beat him up.

The next night the tenth man didn't show up for dinner, so the nine sat down and ate without him. But when it came time to pay the bill, they discovered something important. They didn't have enough money between all of them for
even half of the bill!

And that, boys and girls, journalists and college professors, is how our tax system works. The people who pay the highest taxes get the most benefit from a tax reduction. Tax them too much, attack them for being wealthy, and they
just may not show up at the table anymore. There are lots of good restaurants in Europe and the Caribbean.</i>
</blockquote>


<p>It's important to note that this attack response to a Facebook post of mine was totally unprovoked. He even added this at the beginning:</p>

<blockquote>
 How Taxes Work . . . the story of ten men going out to dinner representing how our tax system in the U.S. works... and why its not smart to continually overtax the rich?

This is a VERY simple way to understand the tax laws. Read on -- it does make you think!!
</blockquote>


<p>The really sad part is that he was trying to 'help' me - he honestly thought I'd read that and say - 'wow, that is so astute. T Davies really helped me understand taxes!'.</p>

<p>Here are the problems with this analogy.</p>

<p>1 - the idea that the bottom 40% of wage-earners don't even pay taxes is demonstrably false. Also, there are things like payroll taxes that don't figure in, and there are things like sales tax that hit lower income people disproportionately - so believe me, poor people pay taxes.
2 - The richest 10% control about <a href="http://motherjones.com/politics/2011/02/income-inequality-in-america-chart-graph">two thirds</a> of the wealth in this country, so if the richest guy in that silly analogy is only paying 59%, he is already paying less than his fair share - it should be closer to 66%.
3 - It is a fact that the super-rich routinely pay comparatively less (percentage-wise) in taxes than their middle class counterparts.
4 - The numbers are just totally off. Shouldn't he have wondered why a university professor didn't link any sources to back up his claim? You know, like a government report or something? We're just supposed to believe this guy, who doesn't really exist, about his numbers that have no source.</p>

<p>So next time someone tries to pull out this tired analogy, bust them on it.</p>

<p>EDIT: I just saw this guy at a wedding in NYC, and although we didn't speak, I did get some more info on him. Apparently, he is the heir to a rather large estate/fortune, so he has a dog in the fight as it were. For someone in the finance industry, it's a shame how clueless he is about taxes.</p>

        <title>almost done</title>
        <link>2011/03/almost-done</link>
        <description><p>I have been pretty hard at work curating all of my old pictures and blog posts. The good news is that this is almost done. I went through all of my old hard drives and collected the missing pictures and I now have a pretty sweet set of blog posts stretching back through the ages. It makes me both happy and sad that when I started blogging we didn't really have RSS feeds, and although I've lost a few pictures here and there most of them have made it all the way here - pictures hosted on Google/Picasa which one hopes won't be going anywhere in the next few years, and web hosting by Rackspace. Times have changed - this is a new decade, and let's hope we don't continue the political downward spiral that we have since the Clinton years. You can read all about my outrage through the two Bush presidencies starting at around page 2 of my <a href="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/topics/archive/page/2/">historical</a> archives.</p>

        <title>checking JRE and JDK versions on a mac 10.6</title>
        <link>2011/02/checking-jre-and-jdk-versions-on-a-mac-10-6</link>
        <description><p>I know it&#039;s not rocket science, but it is worth explaining.</p>


<p>In a terminal:</p>


<pre>
  java -version
</pre>


<p>
will check the JRE version;</p>


<p>whereas</p>


<pre>
  javac -version
</pre>


<p>
will check the JDK version.</p>


<p>like so:</p>


<pre>

zeta:rockstaralley kaxel$ java -version
java version "1.6.0_22"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_22-b04-307-10M3261)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 17.1-b03-307, mixed mode)
zeta:rockstaralley kaxel$ javac -version
javac 1.6.0_22

</pre>


<p>
The JRE ships with the Mac OS (or so I&#039;m told) but the JDK installs with the XCode package.</p>


<p>you&#039;re welcome!</p>

        <description><p>I know, it doesn&#039;t have all the bells and whistles; you need to add the files to git by hand; and you can move right through with unstaged changes with nary a peep in protest. But it still does the trick and makes my life easier - so here it is: my quick and dirty rake ci script -</p>




<script src="https://gist.github.com/860995.js?file=checkin.rake"></script>




<p>
save it in a rake file called whatever you like and do all your checkins, after doing a &#039;git add .&#039; or what have you - like this:</p>


<pre>
rake ci
</pre>


<p>
Done!</p>

        <title>Time out procedure</title>
        <link>2011/01/time-out-procedure</link>
        <description><p>Yeah, I know. We learned this from an episode of SuperNanny.<br/>
It still seems relevant, and could come in handy one day pretty soon.<br/><br/></p>

<p>Step 1: Warning &#8211; come down to their level and make eye contact</p>


<p>Step 2: Send them to time out with an explanation of why they are going there.</p>


<p>Step 3: Walk away and stay away with no communication (1 minute per year of age of child). If they try to leave, put them back with no communication and their time starts over.</p>


<p>Step 4: Second explanation (because now they&#8217;ve calmed down and can hear it).</p>


<p>Step 5: Sorry, hugs and kisses &#8211; they can&#8217;t leave until they apologize.</p>


<p>Step 6: Move on.</p>

<p>We had an amazing time.</p>


<p>I wanted to write some stuff down while it&#8217;s still fresh. I have long written for slightly figurative audiences &#8211; I have had a few different sites, and few different blogs, and always pulled them down eventually either as the march of progress or for lack of enduring desire to continue.</p>


<p>These writings, finally, are only for me and possibly future members of the Axel clan, and that&#8217;s about it. So I don&#8217;t have to feel any pressure. I stopped reading, and eventually stopped writing, for quite a spell through my late 20&#8242;s and early 30&#8242;s, I think largely due to general feelings of inadequacy and specific feelings of angst, but as I grow older I see the power of time more clearly and I am more proud every day of who I am. I have an amazing wife, a soon-to-arrive puppy, and a great future so I want to start again with what amounts to a personal diary.</p>

<p>There are a few main things I remember from this trip, I will try to write about them all. The first thing that comes to mind is the day-trip we took to Geneva, and although Geneva was gorgeous, what I remember most was the view of the Alps coming over the pass from the Jura valley and the great conversations I had with the cab drivers that took us there and back. It felt great to really dig in with my conversational French, and specifically on the way there I really got along with the cabbie. One funny note &#8211; in France, or at least in Jura, taxi drivers assume that the first person will sit in the front. It is very common for them to have stuff in the back seat, so two people taking a cab together will often get split up, one in front and one in back, which seems strange to an American. I was slightly hesitant but it turned out great because we were able to talk the whole way there, which is easily a 45 minute ride. As I think about it, there was a lady who drove us to Geneva and picked us up, but the guy I am talking about actually drove us to Le Grand Bornand from Les Rousses, which is more like a 90 minute ride. No wonder I feel like we got along so well &#8211; we spoke more or less non-stop for way over an hour. </p>


<p>I won&#8217;t get into all the things we talked about, but there are two that come to mind. First was when he asked me about gang violence in Los Angeles. I made a joke and said that yes, there are some bad neighborhoods, but they are mostly south and east of the main city hub, and if any funky cholos or gangbangers decided to come and mess with us in Hollywood, they would probably get stuck in traffic and end up turning around to go home. The point I was making was that L.A. is huge and has a lot of different stuff going on. He thought about that and mentioned that Lyon is like that, or at least certain regions around there, so I took a mental note. Apparently, they also have some amazing restaurants and I almost took us there for a day or two over this trip (we opted for Besançon instead) so that felt a bit like I dodged a bullet. Anyway, he also made a very shrewd point &#8211; which was oddly prescient &#8211; that the difference between France and the US is simply that in France, it&#8217;s mostly just the cops who have guns, and in the US anyone can get their hands on one. He went on to say that it&#8217;s a very effective policy because gangs can only be so bad as long as they are not armed to the teeth. Of course, we got home and in less than a week we had that horrible shooting of <a title="Gabrielle Giffords" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabrielle_Giffords" target="_blank">Gabrielle Giffords</a> and he could not have been more right. Not that gangs were involved per se, but it was clearly a problem with unfettered access to guns by people who should not have ANY access to guns &#8211; in this case a guy with a well documented history of mental illness.</p>


<p>On a less somber note, one of the other things we talked about was Switzerland, which was very interesting. He asked us about our day trip to Geneva the day prior &#8211; there is really only one cab company that serves the Jura region, and he was apparently the boss, so he must have known about our whole schedule. I answered that everything was closed, and he said of course, they are very devout Christians over there (it was a Sunday). I had no idea. Our trip was fun, but all the shops were closed, and now I know why. It turned out to be a blessing, because we probably would have spent a lot more money had the shops been open. There looks to be very good shopping in Geneva although it is quite a pricey town. So we ended up on a bit of a odyssey, basically just looking for places to go that weren&#8217;t closed. We did a lot of walking, as usual. We visited the St. Pierre Cathedral, which was beautiful, and learned about Geneva&#8217;s role in the <a title="protestant reformation" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_Reformation" target="_blank">Protestant Reformation</a> (fascinating). We also saw Calvin&#8217;s chair, which I loved because I have a thing for relics &#8211; inorganic ones, to be sure. Old bones kind of freak me out. Anyway, we ended up at the museum of Archeology, which was more or less a children&#8217;s museum, but was still sort of fun. It was pretty cold that day, definitely a hat scarf and gloves kind of affair, and when we got there we were surprised to learn that entry was free and that the coat room was out in the open, completely unmonitored, and that we were expected to just leave our stuff there. We thought about it for a second, but we really wanted to pull all of our layers off, and so with a &#8216;when in Rome&#8217; attitude we followed suit. An hour or so later, we were happy to see that our stuff was still where we left it.</p>


<p>So I mentioned this to the taxi driver, and he laughed. He said yup, they still work on the honor system in Switzerland. The entire society is very honest and collectively they enjoy a sort of regulated state utopia. They have somehow managed to build in some ways an ideal society. He mentioned that they still sell newspapers on the honor system &#8211; there is a box full of papers, which you just open and pull out a copy and they trust you to then put the right amount of coins in the strongbox. I remember him saying &#8211; &#8220;et si c&#8217;etait en France, dans 5 minutes, il n&#8217;y aura rien, et dans la boite, pas un sou&#8230;&#8221;</p>


<p>So Switzerland really is an anomaly.</p>


<p>In <a href="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/2011/01/christmas-2010-%E2%80%93-things-i-remember-part-ii/">part II</a>, I&#8217;ll talk about our 'fouine' sighting.</p>

        <title>FTPS for dummies</title>
        <link>2011/01/ftps-for-dummies</link>
        <description><p>Yah, I know it&#039;s been a while, but I&#039;ve been busy. Work, family, vacation, video games - it&#039;s a long list.</p>


<p>Anyway, for my first post of the year, I am posting code that I found here:</p>


<p><a href="http://blog.behindlogic.com/2009/03/ruby-ftps-implicit-ssl.html" title="http://blog.behindlogic.com/2009/03/ruby-ftps-implicit-ssl.html">http://blog.behindlogic.com/2009/03/ruby-ftps-implicit-ssl.html</a></p>


<p>written by a nice gentleman named Daniel Parker, who basically got to it first.</p>


<p>I have long known that the standard FTP class that rolls with Rails has no knowledge of or familiarity with FTPS, which is FTP with implicit ssl which is a new standard by our &#039;friends&#039; at Microsoft, who never met a party they didn&#039;t want to piss on (true story).</p>


<p>Anyway, the bullet finally found me and  from now on I will have to learn to make my Rails 2.3.5 app play nice with IIS. First step - connecting via FTPS to pull files down - we used to use SFTP but I guess that was either too simple and/or functional for the Microsoft team to get on board.</p>


<p>I found the above post by Mr. Parker, and it helped a lot. Here is the code:</p>




<script src="https://gist.github.com/860690.js?file=ftps.rb"></script>




<p>
Use it just as you would the FTP class.</p>


<p>Here it is in a rake test task (because I don&#039;t like my test suite to actually connect to live servers):</p>




<script src="https://gist.github.com/860998.js?file=ftps_rake_test.rake"></script>




<p>
Got it?</p>


<p>also many thanks to Daniel Parker for making my life a little easier and posting the code so generously.</p>

        <description><p>La fouine.</p>

<p>That's the name of the little guy we saw on our first day of cross country skiing in Le Grand Bornand. We decided to call him the Duke, and figured that we didn't see him again because he was probably too busy hanging out with Fernando back at the hotel.</p>

<table style="width:auto;"><tr><td><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/o_vZIEK8arDRHpRCL9n9C5i42ncwKoU7q4CX0xgHeYA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_aJ4urxfgN9A/TSt-KYk6CBI/AAAAAAAAAt4/XJVC3o9fgEM/s400/DSC00670.JPG" height="300" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td style="font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:11px; text-align:right">From <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/krister.axel/FranceAndSwitzerland201011?authkey=Gv1sRgCO2DsLKHiJPwWA&feat=embedwebsite">France and Switzerland 2010-11</a></td></tr></table>


<p>This is how it happened - the day we got to Le Grand Bornand, the main cross country slope that you can access directly from town was closed for lack of snow, so we were forced to take the bus over to <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/place?ftid=0x478bfa0994e44959:0x2608ab2be373be21&q=france+les+plans+grand+bornand&gl=us&hl=en&dtab=0&sll=45.935559,6.485623&sspn=0.031044,0.06403&ie=UTF8&ll=45.975969,6.388378&spn=0,0&z=13" target="_blank">Les Plans</a>. This was a gorgeous enclosed valley, and it had snowed recently. There were not too many people around, and it was really a beautiful morning. I think it was around 11am by the time we finally were doing our first run - we were up much earlier, but it took a while to figure out where to go and how to get there.</p>

<p>So Les Plans has a little 5k loop that takes you to the edge of the valley and back - it crosses a little mountain stream and goes through the woods.</p>

<table style="width:auto;"><tr><td><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/K_MSmkW76AYHw2lNR2w9Spi42ncwKoU7q4CX0xgHeYA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_aJ4urxfgN9A/TSt-GM0PWKI/AAAAAAAAAsw/tY_HcwpwXJA/s400/DSC00648.JPG" height="300" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td style="font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:11px; text-align:right">From <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/krister.axel/FranceAndSwitzerland201011?authkey=Gv1sRgCO2DsLKHiJPwWA&feat=embedwebsite">France and Switzerland 2010-11</a></td></tr></table>


<p>And then you pull around and come back on the other side.</p>

<table style="width:auto;"><tr><td><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/ZDNMMl2E-f8imkCoyCNG9Zi42ncwKoU7q4CX0xgHeYA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_aJ4urxfgN9A/TSt-IL18yaI/AAAAAAAAAtY/1l7f_hR0KIA/s400/DSC00661.JPG" height="300" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td style="font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:11px; text-align:right">From <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/krister.axel/FranceAndSwitzerland201011?authkey=Gv1sRgCO2DsLKHiJPwWA&feat=embedwebsite">France and Switzerland 2010-11</a></td></tr></table>


<p>We were finishing our first loop when I saw something going on out of the corner of my eye. I stopped skiing, because I knew something was up. Just as stopped, looking to my right, I saw two beady eyes and a little mouse-looking creature with snow-white fur who was poking his head out of the snow, like a little submarine telescope. Luckily, Lavinia wasn't too far ahead, and I was able to get her to stop and look just as 'the Duke' stood up and gave us another look. This time he looked at us for a few seconds, and cocked his head a little like he was sizing us up. I think I said 'Hey little guy!', and then he was gone.</p>

<p>I wasn't able to get the camera fast enough, but this is a stock photo of a fouine -</p>

<table style="width:auto;"><tr><td><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/ziCmOxBON1alKHbuFW6b_A?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_aJ4urxfgN9A/TX_O-dkEsSI/AAAAAAAAIzo/Q-WUcPdcqDI/s400/fouine%20ph1.jpg" height="354" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td style="font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:11px; text-align:right">From <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/krister.axel/Stuff?feat=embedwebsite">stuff</a></td></tr></table>


<p>We don't have them in the US, but in Britain they call them 'stone martens'. We took that to be a sign of good luck, because they don't interact with people much at all. Later that day, when were having lunch nearby, I asked the waitress about it.</p>

<table style="width:auto;"><tr><td><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/ilcOcW51rLHHU4p9UyO4FZi42ncwKoU7q4CX0xgHeYA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_aJ4urxfgN9A/TSt-IjcmzaI/AAAAAAAAAtg/NNed3GOuAII/s400/DSC00662.JPG" height="300" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td style="font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:11px; text-align:right">From <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/krister.axel/FranceAndSwitzerland201011?authkey=Gv1sRgCO2DsLKHiJPwWA&feat=embedwebsite">France and Switzerland 2010-11</a></td></tr></table>


<p>They had a stuffed marmotte on the wall, which is basically a european squirrel, and I pointed to it and said - in French of course - 'we just got back from skiing, and we saw something sort of like that, but smaller, all in white...' - and she interrupted me. It was probably a fouine, she said. In the winter, their coats change to match the snow. Fascinating.</p>

<p>I have not been able to find a picture of a fouine with it's winter coat - so I imagine it is a pretty rare sighting. It really made our day, and felt like a sign that Le Grand Bornand was indeed a magical place. We hope to get back there soon.</p>

<p>UPDATE: I found a picture of a white 'hermine', which I don't think is exactly the same animal but clearly a close cousin. Our little guy was smaller, and his eyes seemed to be more red around the edges.</p>

        <title>Brave New World</title>
        <link>2010/12/the-privacy-thing</link>
        <description><p>Here&#8217;s what I wanted to mention &#8211; this <strong>Brave New World</strong>, I hope to use this category as something akin to my &#8216;morning pages&#8217;. Of course, for me, they are &#8216;night pages&#8217;. Let me explain.</p>


<p>I was having lunch nearby as I often do, and I usually bring a book or something to read &#8211; I use my phone as a backup, but it&#8217;s never the same. Books are still very useful to me. I have not yet tried Kindle. So there I was, and I sort of on a whim and without much thought brought a copy of &#8216;The Artists Way&#8217;, which someone gave to me a long time ago and I have never been able to get through much of it. I sit down at the bar, put my book next to me, and the bartender immediately says &#8211; &#8216;Great book! I read it and totally loved it.&#8217;</p>


<p>I&#8217;m trying to nod, and I can&#8217;t think of anything to say, and it becomes a bit of an awkward moment.</p>


<p>As is often the case, I am overcome with thoughts and I disengage from reality to some degree. By the time I come to, I have ordered lunch and a beer, and the guy is no longer talking to me. There had been two simultaneous thoughts running through my mind.</p>


<p>1 &#8211; Wow, that totally feels like an insult to me because I feel strongly that I am already a card-carrying &#8216;artist&#8217;, whatever that means, which suggests that I am already going the &#8216;Artists Way&#8217; and screw you for not knowing that;</p>


<p>2 &#8211; Wow, that guy is really reaching out to me and if I should probably acknowledge that in some meaningful way, his whole thing feels vaguely 12-step, there is something really touching about this, how did he experience the book exactly?</p>


<p>It was a real eye-opener for me. I almost felt called out as someone who is still searching for something, and even if I was what&#8217;s wrong with that? But ultimately, I was insulted in some way, and then I was surprised by how insulted I was, and then the inevitable guilt made me feel that I might be turning into a slightly more negative person than I used to be. All in the space of a minute or so, which made for one self-reflective burger.</p>


<p>Anyway, I did get through a bit of a chapter, which basically talked about what the author calls morning pages, which means everyone on the &#8216;Artists Way&#8217; should take the time to write every morning. I immediately thought of myself in college, where all through my dorm year and a few years after that I would force myself to write poetry at night, before I slept. I have a few thousand pages of that stuff. I understood the same concept way before this woman even wrote the book, so it felt vaguely self-affirming. The only problem is that I haven&#8217;t done that in years.</p>


<p>But every day is a new day in the brave new world.</p>

        <title>Old Vicar Laurentii</title>
        <link>2010/12/old-vicar-laurentii</link>
        <description><p>So this family tree thing is a total obsession right now. I have been <a href="http://axel.tribalpages.com/" target="_blank">rocking out</a> on it and the coolest thing happened. I got a match. I searched on one of my ancestors in the Swedish <a href="http://disbyt.dis.se/" target="_blank">census</a>, Bond Anders Andersson and got a match. As it turns out, there is a whole <a href="http://olaus-laurentii.liss.pp.se/index_e.htm">society</a> dedicated to the ancestors of this Olaus Laurentii guy. Pretty cool &#8211; we are direct descendants of his, my sisters and I.</p>


<p>Interesting note &#8211; if you look at the wikipedia page for Olaus Laurentii, you get this:</p>


<hr /><strong>Olaus Laurentii</strong> (died 25 June 1438) was a Swedish ecclesiastic and <a title="Archbishop of Uppsala" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archbishop_of_Uppsala">archbishop of Uppsala</a>.</p>


<p>Olaus Laurentii (who is known under the <a title="Latin" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin">Latin</a> form of his Swedish name <strong>Olof Larsson</strong>) came from <a title="Uppland" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uppland">Uppland</a> and studied at the universities of <a title="Charles University of Prague" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_University_of_Prague">Prague</a>, <a title="University of Leipzig" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Leipzig">Leipzig</a> and <a title="University of Paris" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Paris">Paris</a>. He was elected Dean of <a title="Uppsala Cathedral" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uppsala_Cathedral">Uppsala Cathedral</a> in 1417 and archbishop in 1432. He was ordained in Rome 18 May 1432.</p>


<p>In the conflict between king <a title="Eric of Pomerania" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_of_Pomerania">Eric of Pomerania</a>, the ruler of the <a title="Kalmar Union" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalmar_Union">Kalmar Union</a> countries, and the archbishop <a title="Johannes Gerechini" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Gerechini">Johannes Gerechini</a> in 1419, Olaus acted on behalf of the king and as a diplomatic envoy to Rome in the negotiations to get Johannes Gerechini deposed and the Vadstena monk <a title="Johannes Haquini (page does not exist)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Johannes_Haquini&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">Johannes Haquini</a> elected and ordained (1422) as new archbishop. When he died in 1432, the chapter elected Olaus new archbishop. Olaus had spent long periods in the previous years in Rome and was in good standing with the pope, but the king preferred bishop <a title="Arnold of Bergen" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_of_Bergen">Arnold of Bergen</a>. After Arnold died, he was replaced by <a title="Torlav of Bergen (page does not exist)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Torlav_of_Bergen&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">Torlav of Bergen</a>. Olaus had been ordained by the pope already in 1432, but was accepted by the king only in 1435, during the rebellion of <a title="Engelbrekt Engelbrektsson" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engelbrekt_Engelbrektsson">Engelbrekt Engelbrektsson</a>. In 1436, Olaus and the <a title="Privy Council of Sweden" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privy_Council_of_Sweden">Privy Council of Sweden</a>, over which he presided, turned their back on the king and joined the rebellion.</p>


<p>Olaus Laurentii is said to have died from poisoning by <a title="Almond milk" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almond_milk">almond milk</a>, and according to a later source the regent (later king) <a title="Charles VII of Sweden" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_VII_of_Sweden">Karl Knutsson (Bonde)</a> was responsible.</p>


<p>In 1435, Olaus consecrated the new <a title="Uppsala Cathedral" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uppsala_Cathedral">Uppsala Cathedral</a> which had been under construction for two centuries.</p>


<hr />Which doesn&#8217;t seem to jive with this:</p>


<hr />Olaus Laurentii (1543-1607) was the vicar in Gagnef, the province of Dalarnas län, from about 1572 until his death, and may be considered the most known of the early inhabitants of the parish. He is known by most genealogists focused on this parish, as the ancestor of many, still existing, family branches in Gagnef.</p>


<hr />


<p>Which is what I found in the Laurentii family tree.</p>


<p>It seems to me that there may be a valid explanation here, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olaus_Laurentii" target="_blank">wikipedia Olaus Laurentii (died 25 June 1438)</a> may have been an ancestor of <a href="http://olaus-laurentii.liss.pp.se/olaus_e.htm" target="_blank">Olaus Laurentii (1543-1607)</a>.  To be clear, we have direct lineage to the later Olaus Laurentii (1543-1607), but even the Laurentii website stops cold at Olaus born 1543. The trick is bridging that 100 year gap from 1438 to 1543. It looks like no one has done that yet, although it does seem sort of obvious. I will post more on that later if I can find any genealogical evidence behind the earlier Olaus.</p>

        <description><p>If you are shipping your XT, LX-20 or XT-20, put it in this "shipping mode." It will secure the transport for safer shipping:</p>


<p>WITH NO TAPE in the deck, power up the machine while holding down the "record ready/arm" buttons for tracks 1 and 7.<br />

<p>Many thanks also to Joel Eckels and Chris Pierce as well as Mike Freas, who all made me feel right at home even though I've been out of commission for a while.</p>


<p>Anyway, as of October I will have a bit more free time, so I expect to redesign some of my web sites and finally get around to releasing <b>Pain &amp; Joy</b> properly.</p>

        <title>Reductio ad Absurdum</title>
        <link>2010/08/reductio-ad-absurdum</link>
        <description><p>Reductio ad absurdum is a mode of argumentation that seeks to establish a contention by deriving an absurdity from its denial, thus arguing that a thesis must be accepted because its rejection would be untenable. It is a style of reasoning that has been employed throughout the history of mathematics and philosophy from classical antiquity onwards.</p>


<p>A classic instance of reductio reasoning in Greek mathematics relates to the discovery by Pythagoras - disclosed to the chagrin of his associates by Hippasus of Metapontum in the fifth century BC - of the incommensurability of the diagonal of a square with its sides.</p>

        <title>Precision in speech based communications</title>
        <link>2010/07/precision-in-speech-based-communications</link>
        <description><p>Precision in speech-based communications</p>


<p>I will start with a quote, which is ostensibly a technical communication. Sure it is from a &#039;message board&#039;, which is more or less an informal medium, but that does not mean that universal rules of logic will not apply. Besides, it is a work message board (Campfire), and is used extensively as a measure of our internal communications. I think at the root of it that all communications should and for the most part will be judged mainly in terms of how effective they are, and to a smaller extent in terms of the economy of effort involved with understanding them. So here&#039;s the quote:</p>


<p><b>"the fix that fixes the workflow tests no longer applies, so 2 of the 3 will still be broken - FYI"</b></p>


<p>This is from a small team of developers working together on a single code base, with a set of automated tests that are maintained collectively. The expectations here are as stated above, namely that the message be effective and succinct. What Is Being Said?, as well as How long Does It Take Me To Understand It? should be the two questions in mind when assessing the inherent value of this message.</p>


<p>What Is Being Said?</p>


<p>In essence, we have a simple logical statement here - premise, conclusion. This is so, so that is so. Let&#039;s examine the first part, the premise.</p>


<p><b>the fix that fixes the workflow tests no longer applies</b></p>


<p>There are many potential meanings here, which one might call an ambiguous premise. First, the word &#039;fix&#039; is used as both a subject and a verb, which is bad form. It would be better to replace one or the other with a valid synonym, just to avoid confusion. The &#039;fix that addresses the workflow tests&#039;, perhaps.<br />
Next, we can see that &#039;the workflow tests&#039; are referred to collectively, which is a mistake in specificity. The employee here knows very well that there are only 3 specific tests that are affected - the 3 that are mentioned in the conclusion - but they prefer to describe as little as possible, essentially missing two chances to actually specify them. Of course, brevity is king, but it would be as easy as saying the &#039;fix that addresses the drug_name workflow tests&#039; which is only one extra word but helps us get much closer to a specific and limited subject from which to subsequently draw a conclusion. Finally, the last glaring problem here is that the phrase &#039;no longer applies&#039; is badly worded because it implies another question, namely &#039;why does it no longer apply?&#039;. It is also interesting that the employee goes to a certain length to be non-explicit - vagueness also at the expense of brevity. Did the tests break? Is it true that the &#039;fix&#039; still &#039;fixes&#039; the tests, if it &#039;no longer applies&#039;? The premise itself borders on the nonsensical. Better to say &#039;the drug_name workflow tests are broken&#039;, or maybe &#039;the drug_name workflow tests are no longer needed&#039;, or &#039;the drug_name workflow tests need to be refactored&#039;. All 3 of those different scenarios are perhaps referenced by this statement but we don&#039;t know which.</p>


<p><b>so 2 of the 3 will still be broken - FYI</b><br />
Stemming from an ambiguous premise, this is hard to parse, but we can see a few simple problems with the form again.</p>


<p>First, &#039;2 of the 3&#039; - which three? Using &#039;the&#039; here implies that we know which 3 to which the speaker refers, but this is the first time we hear of that number. So, in essence the reader is forced to conclude that the number 3 refers to the collective statement about workflow tests in the premise, but that is by no means explicit and fails one or both our expectations, depending on how generous you are - either it communicates ineffectively AND takes more time than necessary to understand, or it just takes more time than necessary to understand.</p>


<p>And yet again, the phraseology &#039;will still be broken&#039; implies that we know already that they are broken and are being informed simply that they will remain so, another mistake in the reference chain, if you will. We were never actually told that anything was already broken - if you remember, we were told just that &#039;the fix...no longer applies&#039;, so this conclusion leaves us, among other things, wondering if we were supposed to have had some information in the premise that was never forthcoming.</p>


<p>So, to conclude, we have no conclusion. We are left with more questions than answers. As I just mentioned, we are not sure if we missed something in the premise; we don&#039;t know why whatever just happened only applies to &#039;2 of the 3&#039;; and we have absolutely no expectation for the future which is usually what statements like these are used for. We don&#039;t know if this is a surprise, if someone should be working on it or perhaps already is, if this is a temporary state that will resolve itself somehow; so the usage of FYI is both unfortunate and supremely ironic, because of all the thing we have here, information is not one of them.</p>


<p>So please - be specific. Every time someone misses the opportunity to communicate effectively the whole world gets a little bit dumber.</p>

        <title>how about an update</title>
        <link>2010/07/how-about-an-update</link>
        <description><p>Well, here I am finally writing an actual blog update. I've been tweeting a lot, and posting code/geek stuff on <a href="http://codeboxer.com" target="_blank">codeboxer.com</a>, but not a lot of personal updates. I'm still preparing to release some new music, but I don't have an album cover yet. I am completely out of touch with almost everyone I know, due to a pretty long string of bad phone experiences (theft, not working, etc.) and some tough times at work that leave me feeling a little too angry about the world to reach out at all. But that seems to be changing, bit by bit. Of course I am still completely enamored with my beautiful wife and next year sometime we are going to start a family, so there is a lot to look forward to.</p>


<p>I have been slinging database code for 10 years now, and Ruby on Rails for over 3. What a life this has been so far. In a horrible economy, I managed to pick a career that is still woefully short on good talent and I am very grateful for that.</p>


<p>Tomorrow, I start working from home which is basically a dream come true.</p>


<p>I know I have been slacking a little in terms of releasing music, but I still have some new tracks available<a href="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/2010/04/on-sale-now-at-emusic-amazon-and-rhapsody/"  target="_blank"><here</a> that are new and most of y'all haven't heard.</here</a></a></p>


<p>I am also really excited about 'Pain &amp; Joy', which will be my newest release once I can get someone to do an awesome album cover for me.</p>


<p>Finally, you can hear a sneak preview from the upcoming release at my podcast - <a href="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/RockStarAlley/"  target="_blank">here</a> .</p>


<p>later!</p>

        <title>fun with closures</title>
        <link>2010/07/fun-with-closures</link>
        <description><p>I got burned by not being able to answer the question -&#039;what are closures?" with much of anything. It was pretty embarrassing, seeing as I use them all day. :)</p>


<p>I had a decent enough explanation about passing code blocks around, but what I forgot to mention was the &#039;yield&#039; keyword (which is a bit like talking about soup and forgetting to mention that you have to add water).</p>


<p>Also, I started trying to write up an example (like I have seen Brian Guthrie do so many times) and couldn&#039;t come up with a good one fast enough. </p>


<p>Anyway, I am decidedly a pragmatist and I don&#039;t get as academic as some of my more CS-based brethren, but I decided then to starting boning up on good examples of what closure is so I can do myself justice next time someone asks me that question.</p>


<p>so I found this (by some dude named Paul):</p>

        <title>what he said</title>
        <link>2010/07/what-he-said</link>
        <description><p>This was copied from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/tag/religion/forum/ref=cm_cd_ttp_emf_rft_tft_tp?_encoding=UTF8&amp;cdForum=Fx417AUXOWKSRN&amp;cdThread=Tx3SE2WNQ2I5K1U" title="http://www.amazon.com/tag/religion/forum/ref=cm_cd_ttp_emf_rft_tft_tp?_encoding=UTF8&amp;cdForum=Fx417AUXOWKSRN&amp;cdThread=Tx3SE2WNQ2I5K1U">http://www.amazon.com/tag/religion/forum/ref=cm_cd_ttp_emf_rft_tft_tp?_e...</a></p>


<p>The link may not work forever. It is a fascinating discussion about God. The two camps are:</p>


<p>1 - Jesus is totally real, duh!<br />
2 - Do you even know what a plethora is?</p>


<p>Guess which camp I'm in! I've heard it said best like this (paraphrased, and mind the sarcasm):</p>


<p>"Oh, so Superman, we totally made that up. And the X-Men, that also didn't really happen. Godzilla, also a myth. But Jesus? He's real!"</p>


<p>_______</p>


<p>The one common thread I've found in ALL of my seeking is this: humanity has an inborn desire to be connected to Divine source or nature, somehow- something other, or larger than one-self, or the individual awareness, such as the Collective Unconscious of Carl Jung's description, the Cosmic Consciousness of the New Agers, or whatever you prefer to call it.</p>


<p>Without belief or faith in SOMETHING, existence is simply not possible. This is why I find it more credible to believe that there is an intelligent order of design in the universe, which is fractal in nature (apply the science of mathematics here!) and recursive, as well as spiral and cyclic. Our own minds support this theory because we systemize data according to some kind of intelligent order. Our brains have to interpret our perceptions somehow, even though individual interpretation can and very often is often completely fallible. That, to me, does not suggest 'accidental' development if the universe is in fact fractal in nature.</p>


<p>Most religion, to me, is simply crap because it is only man-made interpretation of what man's 'animal-mind' perceives about divinity or other forces that it cannot otherwise explain. Try explaining plasma energy to an amoeba, if you could somehow communicate with the amoeba. See if the amoeba does not 'deify' you if it could be proven the amoeba has the qualities of the human psyche.</p>


<p>My latest conclusion is this- everything is INTERCONNECTED, and this is an UNAVOIDABLE fact- we all exist on the SAME 'playing field' since all matter is energy at its most basic elemental makeup, and energy has been proven scientifically to be indestructable. Atomic cohesions can be broken into smaller elements, but they can be broken down no further than their most basic makeup, which of course, is ENERGY in a myriad of different configurations.</p>


<p>If the Universe is therefore made up of LIGHT (energy), then the LIGHT must be intelligent and aware, and an active principle in the continuing evolution of universal existence. Whether we 'anthropomorphize' this force or not in our attempt to 'create God in our own image' is largely not a consideration, since the human species is likely only a fractional division of the life extant within the vastness of the universe. It would be arrogant of us to assume otherwise in light of what science has observed thus far.</p>


<p>But we ARE here for a reason, and I don't believe it was through an 'accidental' occurrence that's been labeled as the 'big bang'. I personally believe that we are meant to evolve to a much higher level of consciousness (existence, awareness, reality) than where we are now. Maybe that makes me sound like a New Ager, but so be it.</p>


<p>Then again, we may all be like rats trapped in a huge maze, some "meta-experiment" gone wrong and then abandoned by the 'experimenter', but even at that, there must still be a way OUT of the maze- some doorway or exit that very few but the smartest or most aware find.</p>


<p>If nothing else, then one must AT THE VERY LEAST have a belief or faith in ONE-SELF, or we might as well 'shut the whole thing down'! Get out the nukes and 'have at it' once and for all!</p>


<p>These conclusions are NOT based on any mythology, other than the value that said mythologies have at presenting the most common elements with other systematized schemata from world history.</p>

        <title>gitosis and how to add new repository</title>
        <link>2010/05/gitosis-how-to-add-new-repository</link>
        <description><p>gitosis: how to add new repository</p>


<p>I assume that you already have your gitosis-admin repository working (this is described elsewhere).</p>


<p>   1. cd gitosis-admin &amp;& git pull - enter your gitosis administrative repository and ensure it is up-to-date<br />
   2. $EDITOR gitosis.conf<br />
   3. add [group newreponame] section (newreponame is the name of your new repository being added); add yourself with members = yourlogin@yourhost line; also add writable = newreponame line:</p>


<pre>
          [group newreponame]
          members = yourlogin@yourhost
          writable = newreponame
</pre>


<p>   4. based on my assumption of a correctly setup gitosis-admin repository, you should already have the appropriate public key in the keydir directory, but if not - copy your user's ssh public key to keydir in the form of <a href="mailto:yourlogin@yourhostname.pub">yourlogin@yourhostname.pub</a>, then do git add keydir/yourlogin@yourhostname.pub<br />
   5. git commit -am ‘new repository: newreponame'; git push;<br />
   6. now that you have the new repo permissions configured, let's actually create it. Navigate to the directory holding the files of your project (e.g. cd ~/newreponame), and do git init; git add . - this initializes empty git repository, and then adds all the files to it.<br />
   7. git commit -m ‘initial commit'<br />
   8. git remote add origin ssh://gitosis@yourGitosisServerName/newreponame.git<br />
   9. git push --all<br />
  10. final thing: git config --add branch.master.remote origin &amp;& git config --add branch.master.merge refs/heads/master; alternatively, cd .git &amp;& $EDITOR config, and then add these lines:</p>


<pre>
          [branch "master"]
          remote = origin
          merge = refs/heads/master
</pre>


<p>      Without these lines, you won't be able to git pull.</p>

        <title>gzip for dummies</title>
        <link>2010/05/gzip-for-dummies</link>
        <description><p>GZIP To Compress Files:</p>


<p>The syntax for Gzip is</p>


<p>gzip filename<br />
The resulting file will be filename.gz - notice the .gz file extension. If you were compressing a tar file for example, the resulting file would be filename.tar.gz, and so on.</p>


<p>To achieve better compression, you can use the -9 option. (i.e. gzip -9 filename) This will take a little longer, but will result in your compressed file taking up less space.</p>


<p>GUNZIP To Expand Files:</p>


<p>To uncompress a file, the sister to Gzip is Gunzip. To uncompress a file, simply type</p>


<p>gunzip filename</p>


<p>Just like any UNIX program, full usage instructions for Gzip can be found using the man tool. Simply type man gzipat the prompt for full instructions.</p>

_____</p>


<p>One of my wife's distant friends has attempted to invite herself to stay with us, again. She did this last March, and we used the excuse of me starting a new job and needing to do x, y, and z as well as the "out of town" excuse for any remaining dates. This got us off scot-free, but we both knew the time would come again... and it's here. We need a final solution.</p>


<p>We live in a small 2 bedroom apartment, in New York City. People like to visit here, and they don't generally want to pay for a hotel. We understand this. However, we also don't want people staying with us who we don't know or don't like.</p>


<p>My wife received the following email (summarized):</p>


<p><i>I'm going to be in NYC the night of the 5th to the morning of the 15th for [blah blah blah some work-related singing event thing]. Maria (my boss) said it is on the lower east side at Gramercy Park. I do have another friend who offered me her place to stay, but not for the whole time. Is there a chance that I could stay with you and Jeff for a portion of that time? I'd be using the subway the whole time and I'd be gone from 10-10 probably every day, so I'd be out of your way most of the time. Let me know if this might be a possibility! Your choice on the dates, it's pretty flexible when I stay at her place. Thanks for your help - I hope this works out so we can see each other!<br />
</i><br />
Oh my god. First, I don't even know this woman. I've never even spoken with her. My wife doesn't really like her, but she's one of those people who just won't go away. To complicate things further, my wife is one of those people who doesn't really like to say no or to turn away people from her past, so I'm sure this woman will be following us wherever we go. Granted, they do have history in that they used to go to school together from ages 11-16. A decade ago. Then, they've seen each other sporadically when they've been home at the same time. This complicates the issue a little since it begs the question "does past history automatically equate to present friendship?" Even so, I'm reluctant to allow her stay because it'll set a precedent and possibly ruin the (slim) chances of her just fading into the past, and never hearing from her again.</p>


<p>Further, it really annoys me when people just invite themselves over, or present the possibility of you accommodating them. This is something I strive never to do. If anything, I might "test the waters" by mentioning I'll be in town, and see if an offer comes my way, but suggesting that you should allow me to stay in your apartment with you and your significant other whom I have not met seems borderline if not downright rude. Presumptuous, definitely.</p>


<p>I doubt this will be the last time this happens, so we need a final solution.</p>


<p>The only thing I've thought of so far are:</p>


<p>1. Our apartment has a weird key (true), and we haven't been able to get it duplicated (somewhat true). We need our keys (true). Sorry.</p>


<p>2. Keep it vague. "Sorry, that isn't going to work for us" seems like a pretty good solution, but a) it's still pretty awkward to say to someone, especially since I wouldn't put it beyond this woman to inquire further -- "Why, though? Why can't I stay?" -- and b) it'll be hard to get my wife to say this to her.</p>


<p>Have you had similar experiences? What would you do in this sort of situation? Is getting cornered into an unfortunate situation like this just a fact of life I'm refusing to accept? </p>


<p>and the response:<br />
________</p>


<p>This is a classic case of Ask Culture meets Guess Culture.</p>


<p>In some families, you grow up with the expectation that it's OK to ask for anything at all, but you gotta realize you might get no for an answer. This is Ask Culture.</p>


<p>In Guess Culture, you avoid putting a request into words unless you're pretty sure the answer will be yes. Guess Culture depends on a tight net of shared expectations. A key skill is putting out delicate feelers. If you do this with enough subtlety, you won't even have to make the request directly; you'll get an offer. Even then, the offer may be genuine or pro forma; it takes yet more skill and delicacy to discern whether you should accept.</p>


<p>All kinds of problems spring up around the edges. If you're a Guess Culture person -- and you obviously are -- then unwelcome requests from Ask Culture people seem presumptuous and out of line, and you're likely to feel angry, uncomfortable, and manipulated.</p>


<p>If you're an Ask Culture person, Guess Culture behavior can seem incomprehensible, inconsistent, and rife with passive aggression.</p>


<p>Obviously she's an Ask and you're a Guess. (I'm a Guess too. Let me tell you, it's great for, say, reading nuanced and subtle novels; not so great for, say, dating and getting raises.)</p>


<p>Thing is, Guess behaviors only work among a subset of other Guess people -- ones who share a fairly specific set of expectations and signalling techniques. The farther you get from your own family and friends and subculture, the more you'll have to embrace Ask behavior. Otherwise you'll spend your life in a cloud of mild outrage at (pace Moomin fans) the Cluelessness of Everyone.</p>


<p>As you read through the responses to this question, you can easily see who the Guess and the Ask commenters are. It's an interesting exercise.<br />

<p>EDIT: some key comments added:</p>

<p>It's really interesting that so many people think the request isn't rude. I think it's rude, or maybe a better word is pushy, to ask someone for a favor a second time after you've already been turned down once. I feel like the first refusal is the unspoken social signal that we hope people pick up on so that they don't put us in the position of having to be rude and say no a second time to a request for a favor.
There's a lot of good advice about different ways of saying no - if it were me and I did want to have some future contact (but not a house guest), I would go with "No, we can't , have a great visit, let me know if you have time to meet up, etc..."

<p>Wow, gt2 -- I couldn't have asked for a clearer demo of Guess-type thinking, complete with the assumption that you should never "put [people] in the position of having to be rude and say no" -- italics mine.</p>

<p>For comparably unmistakable Ask-type responses, see dobbs and tkolar.</p>

<hr>


<p>WTF? How on earth is this person being rude? Her email sounds quite polite to me. Your interpretation of it, however, is downright ghastly. Of course, just say no to her question, but crikey, don't blame her for asking it as it's perfectly reasonable. She probably has no idea you dislike her so which isn't surprising based on your post.

<p>Get over it. There's nothing rude about asking to crash at someone's place, particularly in your mid-twenties.</p>

<p>Is getting cornered into an unfortunate situation like this just a fact of life I'm refusing to accept?</p>

<p>The only unfortunate thing in this situation is the fact that your wife doesn't appear to be able to say "sorry, no" to someone asking a favor. That is a fact of life that you had better learn to accept.

        <title>Jackson Browne kicks ass</title>
        <link>2010/02/jackson-browne-kicks-ass</link>
        <description><p>Last night a great thing happened, Joel Eckels put together an amazing benefit for Haiti relief. I think about 30 songwriters performed and the quality of artist was truly outstanding. I was honored to play two songs - the first was "Celebrate Tonight", linked here from my wedding:</p>


<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW89kW5TX-w" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW89kW5TX-w">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW89kW5TX-w</a></p>


<p>and then both Mike Freas and Marlon Grace played with me on "I'm the Gun". When I got off stage, Jackson Browne gave me a compliment about my songs and I was stunned. I still am. Jackson played a really great song called "All Good Things Come To An End" and that was one of the best nights of my life.</p>

        <description><p>Lacking any knowledge of chemistry, prehistoric humans eager for the intoxicating effects of alcohol apparently mixed clumps of rice with saliva in their mouths to break down the starches in the grain and convert them into malt sugar.</p>


<p>These pioneering brewers would then spit the chewed up rice into their brew. Husks and yeasty foam floated on top of the liquid, so they used long straws to drink from narrow necked jugs. Alcohol is still consumed this way in some regions of China.</p>

<p>Back in the 7th grade for a time my friends and I got into Dungeons and Dragons. Our DM made the mistake of thinking that it could be cool to give us a magic book that contained all the spells of all levels that we could read and cast at any time. I admit, it was kinda fun, since we basically became invincible. But it became a huge headache for the DM since we could disintegrate anything he threw at us, and he eventually found a way of taking it away from us. Sigh.</p>

        <description><p>I have been archiving incarnations of my personal web site and blog posts since 2005 now, and I am once again shifting gears in my personal engine of feeds and re-posting mechanisms. :)</p>


<p>Tumblr now is my vehicle for blog posts and I'll just copy over the same copy every time I write something. It's not ideal but it will work for now until I find time to automate the re-posts. At the end of the day, I spend way more time writing it than anything else. The reason I like Tumblr is that it will automate the tweets and the Facebook posts, and that saves me a lot of time right there.</p>


<p>When you are in the top million it really makes you want to keep stepping up your game.</p>

<p>"The trickle-down theory can be examined using the tools of econometrics. But, at least for the US, no such sophisticated analysis is required. The raw data on income distribution shows that households in the bottom half of the income distribution gained nothing from the decades of market liberalism. Although apologists for market liberalism have offered various arguments to suggest that the raw data gives the wrong impression, none of these arguments stand up to scrutiny. All the evidence supports the commonsense conclusion that policies designed to benefit the rich at the expense of the poor have done precisely that."</p>

        <title>cap and trade is bollocks</title>
        <link>2009/12/cap-and-trade-is-bollocks</link>
        <description><p>quoted from: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/07/opinion/07hansen.html" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/07/opinion/07hansen.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/07/opinion/07hansen.html</a></p>


<p>If that isn't bad enough, Wall Street is poised to make billions of dollars in the “trade” part of cap-and-trade. The market for trading permits to emit carbon appears likely to be loosely regulated, to be open to speculators and to include derivatives. All the profits of this pollution trading system would be extracted from the public via increased energy prices.</p>


<p>There is a better alternative, one that would be more efficient and less costly than cap and trade: “fee and dividend.” Under this approach, a gradually rising carbon fee would be collected at the mine or port of entry for each fossil fuel (coal, oil and gas). The fee would be uniform, a certain number of dollars per ton of carbon dioxide in the fuel. The public would not directly pay any fee, but the price of goods would rise in proportion to how much carbon-emitting fuel is used in their production.</p>

        <link>2009/12/i-had-to-check-in-today</link>
        <description><p>What an end of the year it has been. Highs and lows. Mostly highs, I guess. :)</p>


<p>I have been married now for 6 months, and it feels great. I think I am more inspired than ever to create a smart, sustainable and above all creative life for myself along with my awesome partner Lavinia. I have been really digging in with Rails over the last few months. This brings me to my 3rd year straight of Ruby on Rails all the time.</p>


<p>After a career that was at one point exclusively contract for a number of years, I have been a full-time Director of Engineering for almost 2 consecutive years and in that time I have built a best-in-class Rails app for tracking digital pre-paid card sales that has literally changed the landscape in our class of business. Now that we are almost out of beta, it is time for me to start looking for new challenges.</p>


<p>Let&#039;s hope the next few weeks find me a great new company that is either near Santa Monica or ready to let me work from home. My life is Ruby and I won&#039;t disappoint!</p>


<p>thanks</p>

<p>'It is my job to point out that many of the same people who bear direct responsibility for the financial crisis were given positions of great power in the Obama White House, and that in many important ways the Obama appointments represented a resounding reaffirmation of the status quo (I didn't even mention the renomination of Ben Bernanke), and the exact opposite of “change.” One can argue about the extent to which this is true, but I don't think the facts are really in question.'</p>

        <title>Palin and her ghostwriter</title>
        <link>2009/11/palin-and-her-ghostwriter</link>
        <description><p>-- below quoted from HuffPo --<br />
<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/11/13/palins-book-goes-rogue-on_n_357682.html" title="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/11/13/palins-book-goes-rogue-on_n_357682.html">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/11/13/palins-book-goes-rogue-on_n_357...</a></p>


<p>WASHINGTON — Sarah Palin's new book reprises familiar claims from the 2008 presidential campaign that haven't become any truer over time.<br />
Ignoring substantial parts of her record if not the facts, she depicts herself as a frugal traveler on the taxpayer's dime, a reformer without ties to powerful interests and a politician roguishly indifferent to high ambition.<br />
Palin goes adrift, at times, on more contemporary issues, too. She criticizes President Barack Obama for pushing through a bailout package that actually was achieved by his Republican predecessor George W. Bush - a package she seemed to support at the time.<br />
A look at some of her statements in "Going Rogue," obtained by The Associated Press in advance of its release Tuesday:<br />
___<br />
PALIN: Says she made frugality a point when traveling on state business as Alaska governor, asking "only" for reasonably priced rooms and not "often" going for the "high-end, robe-and-slippers" hotels.<br />
THE FACTS: Although travel records indicate she usually opted for less-pricey hotels while governor, Palin and daughter Bristol stayed five days and four nights at the $707.29-per-night Essex House luxury hotel (robes and slippers come standard) overlooking New York City's Central Park for a five-hour women's leadership conference in October 2007. With air fare, the cost to Alaska was well over $3,000. Event organizers said Palin asked if she could bring her daughter. The governor billed her state more than $20,000 for her children's travel, including to events where they had not been invited, and in some cases later amended expense reports to specify that they had been on official business.<br />
PALIN: Boasts that she ran her campaign for governor on small donations, mostly from first-time givers, and turned back large checks from big donors if her campaign perceived a conflict of interest.<br />
THE FACTS: Of the roughly $1.3 million she raised for her primary and general election campaigns for governor, more than half came from people and political action committees giving at least $500, according to an AP analysis of her campaign finance reports. The maximum that individual donors could give was $1,000; $2,000 for a PAC.<br />
Of the rest, about $76,000 came from Republican Party committees.<br />
She accepted $1,000 each from a state senator and his wife in the weeks after the two Republican lawmakers' offices were raided by the FBI as part of an investigation into a powerful Alaska oilfield services company. After AP reported those donations during the presidential campaign, she said she would give a comparative sum to charity after the general election in 2010, a date set by state election laws.<br />
PALIN: Rails against taxpayer-financed bailouts, which she attributes to Obama. She recounts telling daughter Bristol that to succeed in business, "you'll have to be brave enough to fail."<br />
THE FACTS: Palin is blurring the lines between Obama's stimulus plan - a $787 billion package of tax cuts, state aid, social programs and government contracts - and the federal bailout that Republican presidential candidate John McCain voted for and President George W. Bush signed.<br />
Palin's views on bailouts appeared to evolve as McCain's vice presidential running mate. In September 2008, she said "taxpayers cannot be looked to as the bailout, as the solution, to the problems on Wall Street." A week later, she said "ultimately what the bailout does is help those who are concerned about the health care reform that is needed to help shore up our economy."<br />
During the vice presidential debate in October, Palin praised McCain for being "instrumental in bringing folks together" to pass the $700 billion bailout. After that, she said "it is a time of crisis and government did have to step in."<br />
___<br />
PALIN: Says Ronald Reagan faced an even worse recession than the one that appears to be ending now, and "showed us how to get out of one. If you want real job growth, cut capital gains taxes and slay the death tax once and for all."<br />
THE FACTS: The estate tax, which some call the death tax, was not repealed under Reagan and capital gains taxes are lower now than when Reagan was president.<br />
Economists overwhelmingly say the current recession is far worse. The recession Reagan faced lasted for 16 months; this one is in its 23rd month. The recession of the early 1980s did not have a financial meltdown. Unemployment peaked at 10.8 percent, worse than the October 2009 high of 10.2 percent, but the jobless rate is still expected to climb.<br />
___<br />
PALIN: She says her team overseeing the development of a natural gas pipeline set up an open, competitive bidding process that allowed any company to compete for the right to build a 1,715-mile pipeline to bring natural gas from Alaska to the Lower 48.<br />
THE FACTS: Palin characterized the pipeline deal the same way before an AP investigation found her team crafted terms that favored only a few independent pipeline companies and ultimately benefited a company with ties to her administration, TransCanada Corp. Despite promises and legal guidance not to talk directly with potential bidders during the process, Palin had meetings or phone calls with nearly every major candidate, including TransCanada.<br />
___<br />
PALIN: Criticizes an aide to her predecessor, Gov. Frank Murkowski, for a conflict of interest because the aide represented the state in negotiations over a gas pipeline and then left to work as a handsomely paid lobbyist for ExxonMobil. Palin asserts her administration ended all such arrangements, shoving a wedge in the revolving door between special interests and the state capital.<br />
THE FACTS: Palin ignores her own "revolving door" issue in office; the leader of her own pipeline team was a former lobbyist for a subsidiary of TransCanada, the company that ended up winning the rights to build the pipeline.<br />
___<br />
PALIN: Writes about a city councilman in Wasilla, Alaska, who owned a garbage truck company and tried to push through an ordinance requiring residents of new subdivisions to pay for trash removal instead of taking it to the dump for free - this to illustrate conflicts of interest she stood against as a public servant.<br />
THE FACTS: As Wasilla mayor, Palin pressed for a special zoning exception so she could sell her family's $327,000 house, then did not keep a promise to remove a potential fire hazard on the property.<br />
She asked the city council to loosen rules for snow machine races when she and her husband owned a snow machine store, and cast a tie-breaking vote to exempt taxes on aircraft when her father-in-law owned one. But she stepped away from the table in 1997 when the council considered a grant for the Iron Dog snow machine race in which her husband competes.<br />
___<br />
PALIN: Says Obama has admitted that the climate change policy he seeks will cause people's electricity bills to "skyrocket."<br />
THE FACTS: She correctly quotes a comment attributed to Obama in January 2008, when he told San Francisco Chronicle editors that under his cap-and-trade climate proposal, "electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket" as utilities are forced to retrofit coal burning power plants to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.<br />
Obama has argued since then that climate legislation can blunt the cost to consumers. Democratic legislation now before Congress calls for a variety of measures aimed at mitigating consumer costs. Several studies predict average household costs probably would be $100 to $145 a year.<br />
___<br />
PALIN: Welcomes last year's Supreme Court decision deciding punitive damages for victims of the nation's largest oil spill tragedy, the Exxon Valdez disaster, stating it had taken 20 years to achieve victory. As governor, she says, she'd had the state argue in favor of the victims, and she says the court's ruling went "in favor of the people." Finally, she writes, Alaskans could recover some of their losses.<br />
THE FACTS: That response is at odds with her reaction at the time to the ruling, which resolved the long-running case by reducing punitive damages for victims to $500 million from $2.5 billion. Environmentalists and plaintiffs' lawyers decried the ruling as a slap at the victims and Palin herself said she was "extremely disappointed." She said the justices had gutted a jury decision favoring higher damage awards, the Anchorage Daily News reported. "It's tragic that so many Alaska fishermen and their families have had their lives put on hold waiting for this decision," she said, noting many had died "while waiting for justice."<br />
___<br />
PALIN: Describing her resistance to federal stimulus money, Palin describes Alaska as a practical, libertarian haven of independent Americans who don't want "help" from government busybodies.<br />
THE FACTS: Alaska is also one of the states most dependent on federal subsidies, receiving much more assistance from Washington than it pays in federal taxes. A study for the nonpartisan Tax Foundation found that in 2005, the state received $1.84 for every dollar it sent to Washington.<br />
___<br />
PALIN: Says she tried to talk about national security and energy independence in her interview with Vogue magazine but the interviewer wanted her to pivot from hydropower to high fashion.<br />
THE FACTS are somewhat in dispute. Vogue contributing editor Rebecca Johnson said Palin did not go on about hydropower. "She just kept talking about drilling for oil."<br />
___<br />
PALIN: "Was it ambition? I didn't think so. Ambition drives; purpose beckons." Throughout the book, Palin cites altruistic reasons for running for office, and for leaving early as Alaska governor.<br />
THE FACTS: Few politicians own up to wanting high office for the power and prestige of it, and in this respect, Palin fits the conventional mold. But "Going Rogue" has all the characteristics of a pre-campaign manifesto, the requisite autobiography of the future candidate.<br />

<p>Plus, the public plan won't cover abortion care. While plans participating in the health insurance exchange are legally permitted to offer a version of the plan that does cover abortion--enrollment limited to those who pay for the entire plan without any subsidy--it's unlikely plans will go the extra mile to offer that coverage...</p>

<p>by Michael Barone, 'Senior Political Analyst'. Ha! more like, 'Senior Political Jackass'.</p>


<p>The gist is, there was a story about how 'green' groups are disagreeing over how much to offer 'light-on-climate' ads in their public messages - i.e., do we give it to them straight or sugar coat a little so as to not scare anyone into looking the other way - not a bad consideration, in my view. So one party says, we should just 'have faith' in our public that they can handle the truth.</p>


<p>And from this, Michael Barone somehow thinks by asserting that we should 'have faith in the American public' that it equates with there being no 'concrete proof' on global warming; and furthermore by making this erroneous conclusion he has convinced himself that he has somehow categorically refuted the premise that global warming even exists.</p>


<p>Sheesh. Hey Michael Barone - maybe you should work at FOX. They love bullshitters like you. Plus, you're just dumb enough for them to hire. </p>

<p>Sample Letters to Support NCEA ACRE in the Field</p>


<p>NCEA ACRE Sample letter to Parents for Individual Student Reports. Used with permission. There will be additional letters forthcoming as permission is granted for them to appear.</p>


<p>December 3, 2001</p>


<p>Dear Parents,</p>


<p>Your Notre Dame senior recently took the ACRE (Assessment of Catechesis Religious Education) survey. ACRE assesses faith knowledge and the affective domains of beliefs, attitudes, practices, and perceptions. Your child's individual results are included with this letter.</p>


<p>These individual results were sent directly to me and are not part of your child's academic file. The individual results will not be seen by any faculty or staff member of the school or Diocese, and will not influence any course grade.</p>


<p>ACRE was administered to seniors in both Diocesan high schools and to all fifth and eighth graders in our elementary schools. There were two purposes to the administration of this survey: to provide students and their parents with an understanding of the student's faith development and to provide the schools with group data. Each school will use the group data (no names indicated) to ascertain strengths and weaknesses in their religion curriculum. In addition, the Office of Catholic Schools will analyze the group data from all schools as part of a needs assessment for curriculum development. The goal is to improve the religious education and the religious experience of each student.</p>


<p>I am very pleased to announce that the group data for Notre Dame students, both Catholic and non-Catholic, is very good. Our students have a firm understanding of their faith. This is due to you, the parents as the primary educators, your church, the elementary schools, and to Notre Dame's teachers. Thank you for all your support.</p>


<p>Sincerely,</p>


<p>Jo Dean Salley, Ph.D.<br />
Principal</p>

<p>So here we are, a year out from when Sivers sold CDBaby to Discmakers. The whole thing has gone to shyte. The links don't work, my albums are showing up randomly and inconsistently across different digital networks.</p>


<p>All of my options are locked now, meaning nothing can change. Horrible. I guess all good things go away eventually. CD Baby used to be really the best ever. Now, they totally suck.</p>


<p>It is possible that if you are a new client it works fine, but I have 4 albums distributed with them and the user experience for me went from from A+ to a D-. So sad.</p>


<p>Oh Derek - why did you abandon us?</p>


<p>Discmakers sucks. Bring back the old CD Baby. Please. I have had so many problems already! Does anyone know an easy way to port my whole CD Baby catalog to somewhere else?</p>

<p>Yet, even if we think in that sort of outdated terminology, First, Second and Third World, and most Americans do, then America is a Second World nation. We have no universal free health care (don't kid yourself about the plan under way), no guarantee of anything really, except competitive struggle with one another for work and money and career status -- if you are one of those conditioned to think of your job and feudal debt enslavement as a "career" -- high infant-mortality rates, abysmal educational scores, poor diet, no national public transportation system, crumbling infrastructure, a collapsed economy. Even by our own definition we are a Second World nation.</p>

<p> Banks have been silent partners in the meteoric rise of the Federal Housing Administration.</p>


<p>In the past year, the nation's financial institutions have snapped up securities backed by Ginnie Mae, a government-owned agency that guarantees payments on mortgages backed by the FHA. That helped drive demand for Ginnie securities and created an outlet for billions of dollars of FHA-backed loans made to borrowers who in many cases couldn't afford big down payments.</p>


<p>As of June 30, the roughly 8,500 federally insured banks and thrifts were holding $113.5 billion of Ginnie securities, compared with just $41 billion a year earlier...</p>


<p>************************</p>


<p>plus few notes from the blogosphere:</p>


<p>"The irony is that banks that are reluctant to lend and are trying to unload their own mortgage holdings are at the same time helping to prop up the housing market by buying up securities backed by mortgages."</p>


<p>That's not the half of it. Banks are also USING the FHA programs as a way to unload their mortgage holdings, by refinancing mortgages on their books into FHA or agency programs.</p>


<p>The banks could very well be buying back mortgages from the same borrowers who were on their books, except this time wrapped with full faith and credit protection from the government.</p>


<p>The whole mortgage finance industry in this country is a scam.</p>


<p>____</p>


<p>More unintended consequences of well-meaning but misguided regulations.</p>


<p>Risk-based capital rules classify government-guaranteed mortgages as "risk-free," so banks don't have to hold any capital against such assets. This means that banks can lever up on these mortgages, earning assets that require no capital back-up.</p>


<p>In so doing, banks provide an outlet for GNMA to sell off the "new subprime" garbage being underwritten by FHA, just at CDOs were used to sell off the "old subprime" garbage underwritten by Countrywide and Washington Mutual.</p>


<p>Without securitization, we wouldn't have had the subprime bubble that started this crisis. Without securitization, FHA couldn't continue the madness.</p>


<p>These are incredibly risky mortgages.</p>


<p>The risk is all being borne by the U.S. taxpayer.</p>


<p>___</p>


<p>and:</p>


<p>This was NOT unintended. They FHA know exactly what they were doing.(with blessings all around) And don't be surprised if we see even a further expansion of the FHA underwriting guidelines to ensnare an ever bigger amount of dead loans sitting on bank balance sheets.</p>


<p>These banks full well know that the easy FHA guidelines represent the best exit strategy for their troubled loans on thier balance sheet. And while the last bonafide resi securitizations were May '07, since then, banks have accumulated their share of resi loans on their balance sheet that they'd gladly jettison off to FHA land.</p>


<p>And there are those special servicers too that are trying to convert their loans to FHA. Remember, don't be surprised if FHA eligible dollar amounts start creeping up higher....</p>


<p>Short of just giving these banks money, (they are finding this more difficult these days) the alchemists of economics sitting in DC are out of bullets. They are out of ideas. They are soon to be flirting with a $$ that could start to question their open checkbook, and quantifiable and unquantifiable healthcare deficits.</p>


<p>Expect FHA guidelines to easy, elibible dollar amounts to rise. All politically sellable, and quite intentional.</p>

        <title>Obama Wins nobel Peace Prize</title>
        <link>2009/10/obama-wins-nobel-peace-prize</link>
        <description><p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/europe/10/09/nobel.peace.prize/" title="http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/europe/10/09/nobel.peace.prize/">http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/europe/10/09/nobel.peace.prize/</a></p>


<p>Yup, as if we were in a bizarro world, Obama just won the Nobel Peace Prize.</p>


<p>For the first time in a long time, I find myself agreeing with Republicans on this. I just don't feel that he deserves it. Granted, most of my issues with him have to deal with domestic policy, but still there are things that spill over into the world stage that he is responsible for that are antithetic to a 'Peace Prize'.</p>


<p>1 - Guantanamo is not closed. Furthermore, there is evidence that we are still routinely torturing 'terrorists' and claiming 'state secrets' to avoid investigation. Where's the peace in that?</p>


<p><a href="http://www.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/2009/04/30/obama/index.html" title="http://www.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/2009/04/30/obama/index.html">http://www.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/2009/04/30/obama/index.html</a></p>

<p>2 - We are still in Iraq and Afghanistan. Where's the peace in that?</p>


<p><a href="http://blog.puppetgov.com/2009/10/09/continuing-wars-in-iraq-and-afghanistan-obama-wins-nobel-peace-prize/" title="http://blog.puppetgov.com/2009/10/09/continuing-wars-in-iraq-and-afghanistan-obama-wins-nobel-peace-prize/">http://blog.puppetgov.com/2009/10/09/continuing-wars-in-iraq-and-afghani...</a></p>


<p>3 - Obama has made the Israel/Palestine conflict worse, not better, by stocking his cabinet full of AIPAC members without a single Palestinian advocate.</p>


<p><a href="http://tpmcafe.talkingpointsmemo.com/2009/09/20/steve_walt_aipac_still_thwarting_obama_on_middle_e/" title="http://tpmcafe.talkingpointsmemo.com/2009/09/20/steve_walt_aipac_still_thwarting_obama_on_middle_e/">http://tpmcafe.talkingpointsmemo.com/2009/09/20/steve_walt_aipac_still_t...</a></p>


<p><a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-10/09/content_12202013.htm" title="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-10/09/content_12202013.htm">http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-10/09/content_12202013.htm</a></p>


<p>4 - Finally, the mistake Obama made to fill all his Finance positions with Goldman Sachs cronies and ex-Bushies was a slap in the face to Progressive movements everywhere. The corporate handouts have been obscene, and the foul play has been absolutely obvious. The fact that Obama (and his hatchet-man Geithner) have papered over the problem (pun intended) as opposed to attacking the source of it is undeniable and shameful. Where, I ask, is the peace in that?</p>


<p><a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/26793903/the_big_takeover" title="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/26793903/the_big_takeover">http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/26793903/the_big_takeover</a></p>


<p>The only convincing argument I've heard is that the Nobel committee is trying to 'encourage' Obama to continue in his 'pursuits'. All I can say to that is: don't we do that with children? Give them rewards to 'encourage' them?</p>


<p>Real adults get rewarded for results, not pursuits. I am saddened by the Nobel committee, and I agree with many bloggers out there - the only honorable thing to do is give it back. He may yet earn it, and I am pulling for him - but it is way too early to give the prize to him now. There were 200+ other names on that list - I guarantee that there were some REALLY deserving names on there that could have used the money and the publicity to push their agenda along. What a monumental loss of an opportunity.</p>


<p>Ah well - good on ya, Barack, for gaming the system. Here's hoping you live up to what was once a powerful legacy.</p>


<p>My vote would have gone to Greg Mortenson, or someone like him - currently low-profile, and could use some publicity for a simple and solid mission. </p>

        <title>and they said the recession was over</title>
        <link>2009/10/and-they-said-the-recession-was-over</link>
        <description><p><a href="http://www.wsws.org/articles/2009/oct2009/pers-o05.shtml" title="http://www.wsws.org/articles/2009/oct2009/pers-o05.shtml">http://www.wsws.org/articles/2009/oct2009/pers-o05.shtml</a></p>


<p>Despite the claims of economic recovery, the combined total of 834,000 workers either losing their jobs or giving up the search for work is comparable to the 700,000-plus job losses recorded in January and February.</p>


<p>September marked the 21st consecutive monthly decline in jobs—the longest continuous drop in US employment since the Labor Department began collecting such figures in 1939.</p>


<p>Some 15 million American workers are unemployed, nearly double the number out of work when the recession began at the end of 2007. The average duration of unemployment is 26.2 weeks, more than half a year, the highest figure since the Labor Department began such statistics in 1948. One third of the unemployed, more than five million, have been out of work for 27 weeks or more. This is another Labor Department record.</p>


<p>...</p>


<p>Maintaining unemployment at the highest levels since the Great Depression is a deliberate policy of both big business parties and the ruling class as a whole.</p>


<p>While Democratic politicians and union bureaucrats invariably blame the economic collapse, particularly in manufacturing, on foreign competition and imports, the jobs crisis is of global dimensions. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which groups the 30 largest industrialized nations, the jobless rate for all 30 countries will approach 10 percent in 2010—just about the projected average for the United States. Some 57 million people will be out of work by the end of next year—a number equivalent to the total population of France, Italy or South Korea.</p>


<p>The jobs crisis demonstrates the failure of the capitalist system—not only in the United States, but internationally. Not a single capitalist government, in any of the OECD countries, has lifted a finger to create jobs or put the unemployed to work. In each country, the ruling elite is using mass unemployment as a club against the working class, to enforce demands for the destruction of wages, benefits and working conditions.</p>

        <title>The skinny on Lean education</title>
        <link>2009/09/the-skinny-on-lean-education</link>
        <description><p>Very interesting - quoted from <a href="http://esciencenews.com/articles/2009/09/28/the.skinny.lean.education" title="http://esciencenews.com/articles/2009/09/28/the.skinny.lean.education">http://esciencenews.com/articles/2009/09/28/the.skinny.lean.education</a> :</p>


<p>There are several key principles of Lean thinking that can be adapted to adult education and online learning, Alagaraja explains:</p>


<p>    * Cellular processes: allow chunking of coursework so that it can be taught as valid, standalone sub-units of a complete whole.<br />
    * Policy deployment: is a strategic planning process that correlates the purpose of a course with objectives and activities.<br />
    * Flow: encourages learner ownership so that they can dwell on a topic or move along more swiftly depending on their understanding.<br />
    * Just-in-time: provides feedback on projects in time for discussion in next class session/meeting.<br />
    * "Kaizen": Allows educators to adapt the course to learner feedback.<br />
    * "Kanban": Offers learners timely feedback on their mistakes so that they can correct their understanding quickly and effectively.<br />
    * "Poka-yoke": Is mistake proofing, which involves standardizing the syllabus to prevent recurrent problems.<br />
    * "Quality function deployment": Incorporates learner needs into the design and updating of the course content.<br />
    * Standardization: Simplifies assignments to meet learner requirements.<br />
    * Theory of constraints: Identifies barriers, such as technological limitations, and removes them.<br />
    * Throughput: Designs assignments with real-life relevance.<br />
    * Value stream mapping, visual controls, and visual management: Provides a map of the course flow.<br />
    * Waste elimination: Eliminates extraneous material. </p>


<p>Today's adult learning environment emphasizes technology, but beyond the rhetoric of customizing education around learners' needs, the concept of Lean Thinking has the potential to improve learning, reduce time wasted, and make adult and online courses truly applicable to real life beyond the virtual school halls.</p>

        <title>the thundering herd and the dining philosophers</title>
        <link>2009/09/the-thundering-herd-and-the-dining-philosophers</link>
        <description><p>The &#039;Thundering Herd&#039;:</p>


<p>The thundering herd problem occurs when a large number of processes waiting for an event are awoken when that event occurs, but only one process is able to proceed at a time. After the processes wake up, they all demand the resource and a decision must be made as to which process can continue. After the decision is made the remaining processes are put back to sleep, only to wake up again to request access to the resource.</p>


<p>(from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thundering_herd_problem" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thundering_herd_problem">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thundering_herd_problem</a>)</p>


<p>The &#039;Dining Philosophers&#039;:</p>


<p>The dining philosophers problem is summarized as five philosophers sitting at a table doing one of two things: eating or thinking. While eating, they are not thinking, and while thinking, they are not eating. The five philosophers sit at a circular table with a large bowl of spaghetti in the center. A fork is placed in between each pair of adjacent philosophers, and as such, each philosopher has one fork to his left and one fork to his right. As spaghetti is difficult to serve and eat with a single fork, it is assumed that a philosopher must eat with two forks. Each philosopher can only use the forks on his immediate left and immediate right.</p>

        <description><div align="center"><table style="width:auto;"><tr><td><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/VSiI8Pa64BIinNDkWqO96g?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_aJ4urxfgN9A/TXXS3pXeR9I/AAAAAAAAIlE/jjZp0cXeV5s/s144/dinosaur-jesus.jpg" height="144" width="104" /></a></td></tr><tr><td style="font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:11px; text-align:right">From <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/krister.axel/Stuff?feat=embedwebsite">stuff</a></td></tr></table></div>


<p>So let me get this straight:</p>


<p>Noah is supposed to have had dinosaurs on the ark with him? And Jesus 'rode them'? What? This is what they teach the poor kids that are suckered into having the 'Beginners Bible' coloring book?</p>


<p>That doesn't even remotely make sense. even if the 'Noahs Ark' story were true, which it isn't, the dinosaur was wiped out by the end of the Mesozoic era, which is WAY before the Romans and the 3 Kings and all that. So what's up? Besides that, according to their own chronology, the 'flood' was supposed to be about 4500 years ago, which would be roughly 2500 years before Jesus was born - so he went back in time to ride the dinosaurs?</p>


<p>This just goes to explain why all of the Jesus people are confused. The things they are taught just don't add up. It's like they are trying to build little robots that don't EVER ask questions because they know the answers are not really the point.</p>


<p>from wikipedia:<br />
<i><br />
Cognitive dissonance is an uncomfortable feeling caused by holding two contradictory ideas simultaneously. </i></p>


<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance</a></p>


<p>Fact: Dinosaurs lived in the Mesozoic era.</p>


<p>The Dinosaurs and many of the other large prehistoric reptiles existed in the Mesozoic era of the Phanerozoic aeon. The Mesozoic era ran from about 250 million years ago to 65 million years ago.</p>


<p>from <a href="http://www.dinosaur-facts.com/timelines/dinosaur-timeline/" title="http://www.dinosaur-facts.com/timelines/dinosaur-timeline/">http://www.dinosaur-facts.com/timelines/dinosaur-timeline/</a></p>


<p>Fact: According to the Biblical chronology the global flood occurred approximately 4500 years ago.</p>


<p>Also funny: the way <a href="http://www.nwcreation.net/noahsark.html" target="_blank">this dude</a> tries to defend the indefensible. This paragraph is the kicker:<br />
<i><br />
According to the Biblical chronology the global flood occurred approximately 4500 years ago. If this event occurred as described in the Bible, the geological evidence left behind could never be correctly interpreted by a naturalist. Although the earth is covered in monumental volumes of sediment, the existence of modern animals atop these deposits must be explained naturally (i.e. many local floods, gradual deposition over millions of years). However, the Bible specifically says that God caused the earth to be flooded until the waters exceeded the highest mountain by 20 feet (Gen 7:20), and to the extent necessary so no human was capable of surviving without supernatural intervention. The evidence of this event covers the entire world, but can not be correctly interpreted by modern science due to their atheistic philosophy and naturalistic presuppositions.<br />
</i></p>


<p>This is why creationists are generally not sought after for their scientific opinions. :)</p>

        <title>round to function for ruby float class</title>
        <link>2009/09/round-to-function-for-ruby-float-class</link>
        <description><p>I found this on a blog post somewhere, and it works really well. If you need to round your decimals to precision, this is your friend. It&#039;s a method extension for the standard float class in Ruby on Rails. Just save it into your lib/ folder as whatever you want, and &#039;require&#039; it in as needed - like so:</p>


<pre>
  require &#039;float_helper&#039;
</pre>


<p>
I called it &#039;float_helper.rb&#039;.</p>


<p>Behold:</p>


<script src="https://gist.github.com/860803.js?file=float_helper.rb"></script>


<p>
used here to great effect as a simple round to integer:</p>


<pre>
  unaccounted_sales = x["value"].to_f.round_to(0)
</pre>


<p>
but you can specify the precision as you like.</p>


<p>Enjoy!</p>

        <title>Hot dogs versus sushi</title>
        <link>2009/09/hot-dogs-versus-sushi</link>
        <description><p>Lesbians like sushi and bisexuals like hot dogs and sushi. Lesbians would never be interested in eating hot dogs. A lesbian can eat sushi all day every day and never consider hot dogs. In fact, lesbians can never eat too much sushi. A bisexual can go without sushi, then really miss the feel and taste of sushi, because there is nothing like sushi. Then they go out and get some sushi. They swear they can go without hot dogs, because sushi is so much better. They start to eat sushi all day every day. The lesbian continues to do the same.</p>


<p>Then one day the sushi is a little stale and the bisexual remembers how hot dogs are different. She didn't have that problem with hot dogs, at least not that she can remember. Eating hot dogs was easier and less complicated. The lesbian does not start to crave a hot dog when this happens. The lesbian knows she only likes sushi, so even though it got stale, she is still focused only on the sushi. She wants the sushi to get better, because she knows really great sushi is hard to find. The bisexual won't try as hard to figure out why the sushi got stale. Sooner or later she will do what is easier. She will go out for a hot dog. There are hot dogs on every corner and she knows she'll have a few to choose from soon enough. Perhaps she will just have hot dogs for a long time or will try some hot dog rolls or sushi dogs. This is why I prefer lesbians. The only problem is that they may go out for some completely different sushi, thinking that the new sushi will be different. But at least they are aren't out eating hot dogs.</p>

I'm not expecting you to be a full out Fembot, or the latest Pixar render farm, but you should at least be a stable operating system and not tied down to any network. (I said stable, as in predictable, no random crashes or zombies. No excessive blue screens or personal daemons either please.)</p>


<p>I am a sucker for high end graphics. Up to date virus protection is a must. Please have a job, other than just farming gold in WOW. Passing the Turning Test is a major plus.</p>


<p>A little about me: I am a male bot with gigabytes of drive and a positronic attitude. I may not be the prettiest of interfaces, but I am CD ripped, and I must admit, people often tell me that I could pass for an Autobot. I have been known to interact with a female hacker from time to time. I hope this is within protocol.</p>


<p>I can entertain myself with minesweeper and solitaire, but always up for a nice game of chess. I enjoy Opera, Wine, and cookies. I love to travel and explore via Google Earth, and have brought back many tokens to share.</p>


<p>Thanks for processing my post.</p>

        <title>the halting problem and p equals np</title>
        <link>2009/09/the-halting-problem-and-p-equals-np</link>
        <description><p>from wikipedia:</p>


<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem</a></p>


<p>In computability theory, the halting problem is a decision problem which can be stated as follows: given a description of a program and a finite input, decide whether the program finishes running or will run forever, given that input.</p>


<p>Alan Turing proved in 1936 that a general algorithm to solve the halting problem for all possible program-input pairs cannot exist. We say that the halting problem is undecidable over Turing machines.</p>


<p>And p = np : </p>


<p>In essence, the question P = NP? asks: if 'yes'-answers to a 'yes'-or-'no'-question can be verified "quickly" (in polynomial time), can the answers themselves also be computed quickly?</p>


<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_%3D_NP_problem" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_%3D_NP_problem">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_%3D_NP_problem</a></p>


<p>I don't know why, but I love this stuff. I personally think <b>p</b> <i>DOES</i> equal <b>np</b> but I can't prove it.</p>

        <title>why Yahoo news is just like FOX</title>
        <link>2009/08/why-yahoo-news-is-just-like-fox</link>
        <description><p>Yahoo is quickly becoming the same slobbery propaganda-spewing hate-maw that Fox is. Here's how you know. Of course, this story was 'provided' by the New York Times, which some say is a 'liberal' source - but admittedly, only on 'cosmopolitan' issues like gay marriage, as opposed to 'hard' news like fiscal or domestic policy where most people don't pay attention but the ones that do mostly accuse The Gray Lady of actually being conservative.</p>


<p>Here is the untenable nugget of right-wing silliness:</p>


<p><i><br />
If the president's proposals are all adopted, the figure that year will be 20.7 percent, with increases from 2009 for every group — those with the lowest incomes as well as those with the highest. How can that be, given that the president has promised to raise taxes only on those who make at least $250,000 a year?</i></p>


<p>Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, points to two reasons. First, Mr. Obama does not want to continue some special tax breaks, like a tax credit for new homeowners, that were part of the stimulus package he pushed through Congress. More important, the 2012 estimates assume a better economy, in which incomes will be higher and more people will therefore be in higher tax brackets.</p>


<p>Mr. Williams argues that, eventually, President Obama's vow not to raise taxes on the middle class is going to have to be violated. “There is just not enough money” earned by the very, very rich, Mr. Williams said.<br />
</p>


<p>What?</p>


<p>There is <b>'just not enough money earned by the very, very rich?'</b>.</p>


<p>What planet are you on, Floyd?</p>


<p>Have you read this:</p>


<p><a href="http://www.demos.org/inequality/numbers.cfm" title="http://www.demos.org/inequality/numbers.cfm">http://www.demos.org/inequality/numbers.cfm</a></p>


<p>Here's a highlight for you:<br />
<i><br />
The richest one percent of U.S. households now owns 34.3 percent of the nation's private wealth, more than the combined wealth of the bottom 90 percent. The top one percent also owns 36.9 percent of all corporate stock.</i></p>


<p>You don't have to raise taxes on the middle class.</p>


<p>You just don't. The top 10% is all you need.</p>

        <link>2009/08/sarah-palin-gives-dumb-a-bad-name</link>
        <description><p>This is funny:</p>


<p>On Friday, former <span class="yshortcuts" id="lw_1249932567_5">Gov. Sarah Palin</span> raised more than a few eyebrows with a <a href="http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/ynews/pl_ynews/storytext/ynews_pl857/33000084/SIG=11nitu5im/*http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=113851103434" target="_blank"><span class="yshortcuts" id="lw_1249932567_6">Facebook</span></a> post on Obama's "evil" vision for health care. In it, she claims that the administration's bill includes "death panels" that would decide who receives health care:</p>


<p></p>


<p style="padding:0 20px 1em; font-style:italic;">The America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with <span class="yshortcuts" id="lw_1249932567_7">Down Syndrome</span> will have to stand in front of Obama&rsquo;s &ldquo;death panel&rdquo; so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their &ldquo;level of productivity in society,&rdquo; whether they are worthy of health care. Such a system is downright evil.</p>


<p>
Appearing on ABC's "This Week," <span class="yshortcuts" id="lw_1249932567_8">Newt Gingrich</span> <a href="http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/ynews/pl_ynews/storytext/ynews_pl857/33000084/SIG=12kqeu8gu/*http://blogs.abcnews.com/george/2009/08/gingrich-defends-palins-death-panels-.html" target="_blank"><span class="yshortcuts" id="lw_1249932567_9">defended</span></a> Palin's attack on "death panels," even after <span class="yshortcuts" id="lw_1249932567_10">host George Stephanopoulos</span> helpfully pointed out that the bill doesn't actually include any kind of provision for "death panels."</p>

        <title>in the words of barack obama</title>
        <link>2009/08/in-the-words-of-barack-obama</link>
        <description><p>This is a link to a story Barack posted on the Washington Post last month.</p>


<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/11/AR2009071100647.html" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/11/AR2009071100647.html">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/11/AR200907...</a></p>


<p>I find it sort of fascinating that we have in a few short generations gone from the 'fireside chat' to the on-demand blog post. :)</p>


<p>Although this was already news a few weeks ago I needed to show fairness because my last post was sort of critical of Barack. Just to be clear, Barack is not doing anything that Bill Clinton didn't do in the early 90s, which is to say talk 'left' and move 'center-right'. It's just that I am smarter now, or at least more informed, and if I had been quite a bit more political and maybe a little bit more sober during my early twenties I would have fought NAFTA and the School of the Americas and the tax cuts and the pardons and the financial deregulation that got us here. Anyway, that being said here is breakdown of what the Obama administration is proud of.</p>


<p>The financial crisis - on this one I can't give him a pass. Here is what he says:</p>


<p>The swift and aggressive action we took in those first few months has helped pull our financial system and our economy back from the brink.</p>


<p>This I don't buy for a second. Throwing money at bad debt for your cronies in the banks without demanding they go into receivership is called sweeping the problem under the rug. Obama had a chance to hold their feet to the fire and all he said was 'psyche'.</p>


<p><a href="http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=D96FH8I00&amp;show_article=1" title="http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=D96FH8I00&amp;show_article=1">http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=D96FH8I00&amp;show_article=1</a></p>


<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act - this seems like some decent legislation.</p>


<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Recovery_and_Reinvestment_Act_of_2009" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Recovery_and_Reinvestment_Act_of_2009">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Recovery_and_Reinvestment_Act_of_2009</a><br />
<a href="http://market-ticker.denninger.net/archives/1294-For-Want-Of-An-Or-Else.html" title="http://market-ticker.denninger.net/archives/1294-For-Want-Of-An-Or-Else.html">http://market-ticker.denninger.net/archives/1294-For-Want-Of-An-Or-Else....</a></p>


<p>There seems to be money for a lot of domestic programs that need help. Of course there are more tax cuts, some more bank bailout money and some other pork but for the most part this seems like smart spending. Of course the total here is about half a trillion dollars which is still less than the 700 billion in TARP money (linked here - <a href="http://www.prisonplanet.com/the-secret-history-of-tarp-how-goldman-bailed-out-goldman%E2%80%A6.html" title="http://www.prisonplanet.com/the-secret-history-of-tarp-how-goldman-bailed-out-goldman%E2%80%A6.html">http://www.prisonplanet.com/the-secret-history-of-tarp-how-goldman-baile...</a>) that we know about - so the banks get bailed out faster and bigger than the people. But at least there's something.</p>


<p>Health Care - it's hard to give points for taking single-payer off the table, so I won't do it. Read this: <a href="http://www.adn.com/opinion/compass/story/893083.html" title="http://www.adn.com/opinion/compass/story/893083.html">http://www.adn.com/opinion/compass/story/893083.html</a></p>


<p>And finally, we have the new college tax credit. Read here: <a href="http://collegesavings.about.com/b/2009/02/12/the-stimulus-package-and-college-costs-an-update-on-the-american-opportunity-tax-credit.htm" title="http://collegesavings.about.com/b/2009/02/12/the-stimulus-package-and-college-costs-an-update-on-the-american-opportunity-tax-credit.htm">http://collegesavings.about.com/b/2009/02/12/the-stimulus-package-and-co...</a></p>


<p>This seems like a decent implementation of a good idea. I'm not sure how a $2,500 tax credit is going to put your kid through college but it can't hurt.</p>


<p>So that's it - the rest of <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/11/AR2009071100647.html">Obama's</a> post is more or less fluff, where he says things like:</p>


<p>Already, we're making progress on health-care reform that controls costs while ensuring choice and quality, as well as energy legislation that will make clean energy the profitable kind of energy, leading to whole new industries and jobs that cannot be outsourced. </p>


<p>Of course there are no specifics on health care or energy legislation, so I guess we'll have to give him a pass on that for now.</p>


<p>So, as far as I can tell that gives Barack a 2 out of 4. Thanks for playing. I suppose that's better than shrubbie would have done. :)</p>

        <title>things you should know about the Obama administration</title>
        <link>2009/08/things-you-should-know-about-the-obama-administration</link>
        <description><p>For every good thing he does, there are about 10 more things that are downright Bush-y.</p>


<p>Oh Obama, we needed better. What have you to say in defense of your administration?</p>


<p>Did you know, for instance, that they...</p>


<p>...steered hundreds of billions of bail-out dollars to the very people who drove the country into the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, required nothing of these sharks in return, and did almost nothing for ordinary Americans struggling to survive this disaster?</p>


<p>...opposed congressional legislation limiting financial institution incentive pay packages that put the whole global economy at risk?</p>


<p>...opposed legislation allowing shareholders the right to have even a non-binding say on salaries, even though executives took home billions in bonuses last year while their companies were hemorrhaging money so badly they required a trillion bucks in taxpayer bail-out?</p>


<p>...actually threatened Britain, America's closest ally in the world, with withdrawal of intelligence data that could prevent terrorist attacks unless the British government blocked one of its courts from accepting documented evidence of torture at Guantanamo?</p>


<p>...sent droves of Predator-launched missiles into Pakistan - supposedly one of America's allies - killing groups of civilians, even at weddings, thus intensifying hatred toward the United States?</p>


<p>...tried to shut down a charity's illegal-surveillance suit against the government on the basis of a supposed constitutionally-grounded state secrets privilege which would allow the president to kill any legal case before it is even heard?</p>


<p>...undertook a blitz of immigration enforcement without reform of civil rights violations so nasty that one professor of immigration law described the policies as "literally the worst of all worlds"?</p>


<p>...refused to set legally enforceable immigration detention rules covering such basics as health care and legal representation, instead relying on a flawed contractor-based monitoring system?</p>


<p>...pressured a member of Congress to withdraw an amendment that would have ended the military's disastrous "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" regime, simply by defunding it?</p>


<p>...asked a federal court to dismiss a case in which the plaintiffs challenged the discriminatory Defense of Marriage Act, arguing to the court that heterosexual marriage is "the traditional, and universally recognized, version of marriage"?</p>


<p>...dramatically increased the influence of religion in government, directly violating the First Amendment, by lavishly spending federal dollars on "faith-based' programs, and giving religious groups massively increased power and access within the White House to shape policy questions?</p>


<p>...stood by silently, allowing climate legislation to be watered down to nothing, to include generous pollution allowances to coal utilities, and to undermine the EPA's authority to control carbon emissions?</p>


<p>...backed healthcare legislation that did little for the public and actually increased wasteful federal expenditures, while continuing to enrich insurance, medical, hospital and pharmaceutical corporation vampires?</p>


<p>need I say more?</p>

        <description><p>I can't do it.</p>


<p>I can't watch television. I try. I want to, occasionally. But I get fidgety. Not in the standard kind of 'Peanuts' way, where voices of 'authority' seem to sound like underwater whale cries but in the I-totally-know-what-you-are-going-to-say-before-you-say-it kind of way. That's what I get from TV now - a fast read on whatever the underlying shill is, and I spend the rest of the time wondering why the hell they are still talking.</p>


<p>You burn more calories SLEEPING than you do watching television. Think about that. I think that's why I have turned to web surfing from channel surfing - it may be just as tedious but at least you really are engaged, and you really are in control - at least compared to having a single choice of local cable service. That's why I love technology - as a blogger, my life of leisure has now fused with my life as a seeker of truth and my life as an artist - through the channels of rss, http and now increasingly Twitter, I can relax, learn and self-express in the same interactive environment.</p>


<p>Can your TV do that?</p>

        <title>Get back to work</title>
        <link>2009/07/get-back-to-work</link>
        <description><p>I am home now. I learned a few things in Europe. My wife and I had a truly amazing trip to Paris, Rome, Barcelona, San Sebastian (aka Donostia), Cahors, Annecy and then back to Paris. We tried not to take anything for granted and we truly felt completely blessed to have such a great trip with more or less awesome weather. With the exception of about 2 days in Annecy, the only thing that could be said about the weather is that it was occasionally a little TOO sunny. :)</p>


<p>That being said, I learned a few things.</p>


<p>1 - We should be grateful (here in the US). The rest of my comments will be more less critical of the US when compared to the above-mentioned places, but it deserves to be mentioned first that even in big cities like Paris and Rome you will find yourself waiting around a lot longer (and looking a a lot harder) than you are used to for things like breakfast, last minute booze necessities, an internet connection, or any of the many sundry things that we modern consumers look for obsessively. Now that I am home, I am within 50 steps of late night food, a Starbucks that opens at 5:30am, and a CVS that closes way later than I need it to.</p>


<p>2 - Lunch is the day's gift to you and will be ignored or taken lightly only to your own detriment. Some of my favorite moments were in Paris and Rome and some other places where if you can find a restaurant at the optimum place in its lunch rush (too early often means bad service, so you want to get in around 2pm) you can get in and out pretty quickly and feel sort of nourished by the warm blanket of the local hustle. We always looked for places that were at 80-ish percent with people that are really eating (instead of just drinks) so that you could tell it was busy because the food was good.</p>


<p>3 - As a correlary to two, when possible get the 'menu' or 'formule', which is basically a line-up of daily specials with an added cost savings; failing that at least get a daily special if they are available only by themselves because they are often awesome and very 'a propos' of the local region.</p>


<p>4 - Rock the vino in the carafe. A full bottle is often too much for two people over lunch, but the 'demi' carafe is half a liter and is 2 good glasses each which is all you need. By the time you have had the obligatory espresso (skip the milk because it's expensive and pointless), the wine has worn off and you're feeling pretty good. We had a demi carafe of rose with almost every meal and it was delicious. I also suspect the wines in the carafe are more suitable for lunch because they seem to be a little lower proof (weaker by volume).</p>


<p>5 - It's good to get around. The pure joy of travel is pretty hard to beat, as long as you're ready to roll with the punches a little bit.</p>


<p>6 - Always ask for what you want - nicely. This is more of a life lesson, but it's good to always stay nice because you may actually get what you want (although not always) if you communicate it correctly, and if you get mean you will end up regretting it. It's also better that way for the other person. :)</p>


<p>7 - CNN is crap - really a great big stinking propaganda turd, and although the BBC has it's own smaller problems it is generally informative and far less biased than CNN. Oh media, how far have ye fallen?</p>


<p>8 - Rome is a sweet elixir for really anything. I have heard some criticisms about Rome, most of which I don't agree with. The only negative we found about Rome is that if you don't speak Italian a lot of the merchants/restaurants will try to price gouge you, but as long as they have printed prices you're basically ok and if they don't just be ready to haggle.</p>


<p>So that's it for now, more later.</p>

        <title>status codes 101</title>
        <link>2009/06/status-codes-101</link>
        <description><p>Ah, the old http status code. Very nice. I recently built my first pro-grade web service and had some problems figuring out the status codes. Here are some tips from my friend happyfrenchy2:<br />
<i><br />
Usually I write my rest service so that a problem with the parameters (wrong ID, not enough params, etc) returns a 400 (bad request), a auth failure (wrong signature) returns a 403 (forbidden) and an internal problem (couldn't access DB for instance) returns a 503 (server error). Return code 500 should be when the error happens before your code was even reached (like the server or web-server is down).</i></p>


<p>Very helpful. This is what that looks like, in the create method of the /installs web service:</p>

        <title>facebook political saga one</title>
        <link>2009/06/facebook-political-saga-one</link>
        <description><p>This is becoming quite the regular feature. On the heels of showing you the ugly face of mindless dogma-driven religious psycho-babble, we have a great example of mindless dogma-driven political psycho-babble. It all started when a friend posted a short message about the "only sure thing in life is change".</p>


<p>My favorite points:</p>


<p>1 - friend1 who is the right winger vitriol machine by post 5 is already trying to calm herself down. :)</p>


<p>2 - although friend1 never actually links to any source, or even mentions one, by post 8 the original poster has already 'hosted' a debate in the past tense. I guess a debate for FOX people is basically one person screaming and it lasts about 30 seconds.</p>


<p>3 - friend1 has pretty bad spelling and grammar, which is such a pattern for right wing hate spewers (see any comment thread, anywhere) that it bears mention. Thanks for being typical!</p>


<p>4 - 'Let's not confuse "complaining" with the facts' is a non-sequitur. You can still complain about facts, and by the same token, you are by no means forced to complain about untruthful propaganda. But that is probably confusing for our friend1 who seems to think these 'facts' that no one can verify entitle her to turn a little status update into a political dog fight.</p>


<p>5 - Notice how people on the right are always the first to lower the bar. Ok, so I started with a question: "why are you complaining?", which to me is an invitation to discourse, although possibly tainted with a little antagonism. But that's a far cry from 'quit believing what the left-winged media spoons [sic] feeds you and start using the brain that God gave you', which to me is more than a little insulting, pre-supposes a Christian heritage, and is of course a directive (a diplomatic no-no).</p>


<p>6 - friend1 has no more to say at all, if she actually responds I will post again.</p>


<p>7 - Finally, to my mind the real tragedy is that we have plenty of things to be angry at Obama about, and this is not one of them. Just another case of some Texas girl (friend1 is from the Bush state) parroting right-wing propaganda because she likes to be a bitch, <i>just a little bit</i>, with no respect for the Academic tradition of actually 'sourcing' your data. Sheesh.</p>


<p>Anyway, without further ado, here it is:</p>


<hr />


<p>status update by (<b>OP</b>): .......The only sure thing in life is change......</p>


<p><b>friend1</b>: ...and death and taxes. When Obama is done with us we will even be taxed for dying. Good times...</p>


<p><b>me</b>: <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/28418678/the_death_tax_scam" title="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/28418678/the_death_tax_scam">http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/28418678/the_death_tax_scam</a></p>


<p>Estates worth up to $7 million per couple, and $3.5 million for individuals, are already exempt from taxes — meaning that 99.75 percent of all Americans die without paying a dime to Uncle Sam.</p>


<p>Are you really worth over $7 million?...</p>


<p>If not, why are you complaining?<br />
If so, why are you complaining?</p>


<p><b>friend2</b>: um, i do believe bush pretty much took care of that.</p>


<p><b>friend1</b>: Ah, yes. What RS and the other liberal media venues fail to mention is that under your president's plan, by 2011, the exemption will be back down to $1,000,000 at a 55% rate. What this means is that when our loved ones die and pass on money, property, businesses, etc., we will have a short time to come up with the tax. If the capital is not readily available, we must start selling off assets to cover said tax. Look at the economy now. The value of land and improvements has severly declined, even though tax records may have the property valued at a much greater rate per previous years. Have you ever heard of "house poor"? This could potentially be far more severe to you and me, meaning we could lose our own personal property in the deal. Uncle Sam waits for no man.<br />
Your boy Obama and his pals Reed and Palosi have an agenda. Quit believing what the left-winged media spoons feeds you and start using the brain that God gave you.<br />
Let's not confuse "complaining" with the facts.</p>


<p><b>friend1</b>:  Oh, and <name>, you said bush...</name></p>


<p>Here's an idea...Let's all do some yoga and CHILL!</p>


<p><b>OP</b>: Exactly!! You have 4 years before you can change that choice!</p>


<p><b>friend2</b>: LOL I just got it <op>. <friend1>, not much up to snuff here on the economic aspects, although I am trying to learn. But I can assure you that even with my current disappointment with this admin I can safely say it is FAR better than what the alternative being offered. Not going to get into it here but if you want, we can have a drink sometime...would loveto hear differing POV's. Academic debate if you will. Love ya...Peace out</friend1></op></p>


<p><b>OP</b>: Death &amp; Taxes were far from my mind.......I was just thinking about your everyday no big deal or maybe some big changes..........</p>


<p><b>friend2</b>: lol. see what a simple thought can produce...you instigator..</p>


<p><b>friend1</b>: I am always up for cocktails and friendly banter. What are you doing these days? <b>OP</b>, thanks for hosting the debate! ; ))</p>


<p><b>friend2</b>: yes <b>OP</b>, thanks for hosting. I have most nights free. just let me know.</p>


<p><b>friend3</b>: funny stuff above. I think <b>friend1</b> needs some yoga!</p>


<p><b>me</b>: Got any 'sources' on that?</p>

<p>It's not like this didn't just happen to us about 9 years ago; or basically every 2 years since.</p>


<p>Of course, the alleged fraud is on a scale even bigger than we we are subjected to in the US - so far - but the premise is the same:</p>


<p>Subvert the will of the people, ostensibly 'for their own good' and don't take no for an answer. Shoot if necessary. And make the lie really big.</p>


<p>Fascism has grown up for the 21st century and it is a bitch.</p>

        <title>more discussion of faith</title>
        <link>2009/06/more-discussion-of-faith</link>
        <description><p>Last week, I had a post about a conversation between Facebook acquaintances that I think is just priceless. Last time, I commented but this time there is literally no need. This stuff is fascinating and relevant in its raw state.</p>


<p>There are some real doozies in here - everything below this line was not written by me.</p>


<hr />


<p><i><br />
Your Status: A question for my religious friends(all of you, pretty much); Isn't "faith" just a word for "I believe it because I want to"?<br />
</i><br />
My Response: </p>


<p>interesting question... I enjoy this type of question when it is sincerely asked because it isn't one I thought of and sometimes the non-religious see things through shades of a different tint then I do... and therefore ask questions that leave me thinking: how do I explain it? </p>


<p>I wouldn't say that belief is only "because I want to" because, at least for me, belief includes a lot of things I wouldn't mind not believing in so it isn't a matter of want. I don't want to believe that hell or the devil exists but I do... there is good stuff I believe too... but with it there is some not so fun stuff. And being Catholic there are sure a lot of sins to avoid (like dodging land mines)</p>


<p>I think the best way to explain it (and it doesn't really explain it at all) is: For those who believe no explanation is necessary and for those who do not no explanation will ever be enough. I believe because I sense a lot of magic in the world and feel that nature/science is so intricate that there is a design... anyway sorry that this was so long... but you asked ;) a good movie to rent (but it could be a snore fest because it is black and white and there aren't any car chases or explosives) is: The Song of Bernadette - it won an Academy Award for best picture the year it was out so I think even the non-religious enjoyed this movie - but it is very Catholic. that is where I got that quote I mentioned earlier from. I bet Lisa would like it if she hasn't seen it already. :)</p>


<p>>>> Your Response to that:</p>


<p>I agree, there is probably intelligent design of some kind. Any objective view of life makes it hard to believe otherwise. But why Christ over Vishnu, or Allah over Yahweh? Why the need to stack magic and antiquated dogma on to it? To say it more simply: Isn't the miracle of birth magical enough? Do we need virgin birth? Especially given the amount of other Iron Age mythology that includes things like saviors being born from virgins or great floods ect. The closer I look at organized religion the more obvious it becomes that it is a construct of humans, not gods. But, again, what is so obvious to me is not to the great majority of people and I'm not so arrogant as to think them all stupid so I don't know. I don't know anything for sure, but I just find the idea of a "personal god" , watching over everyone improbable to say the least.</p>


<p>>>> My Response:</p>


<p>Okay... these are broad questions you ask so I'm trying to think of a way to be concise and thoughtful which I already know cannot pull that off so I apologize in advance. Also I'm speaking for myself here (I'm not an authority of the Catholic church, but I am going to speak as a Catholic... take what I say with a grain of salt). </p>


<p>To answer your questions:</p>


<p><i>Your Question: Why Chirst over Vishnu, or Allah over Yahweh? </i></p>


<p>For me: I think we all start with what we know and that is what I did. I was born Catholic and hated going to stuff as a kid but then in high school there were some dynamic speakers who got my attention: which was great because that is around the time I really started to have questions (like this one). So it started for me with my mother (forcing me to go to church) and it started with what my culture is. However then learning the history of the world and of the church kept me going. From Judeaism to Christianity and the liniage [sic] of popes and stories of the saints... all of that made me feel like the Catholic Church wasn't found [sic] just yesterday and there is a lot to back it up... most questions that came to my head there was an explanation. There is a trail that goes back to the start and then to today. Does it all make perfect sense: NO! But it is there.</p>


<p>Organized Religion is a disapline [sic]. Like playing music or a sport: if you really care about it then you are involved and practice. If I believe that there is a design to the world then I believe there is a designer... and if I believe there is a designer then that sure keeps me curious about this designer. And if I feel every joy I have ever experienced and any joy I will experience in the future is at the hands of this designer then I want to express my gratitude and how thankful I am. Not just that but how can I help but love someone who loves me enough to do this for me?</p>


<p><i>Your Question: Isn't the miracle of birth magical enough? Do we need virgin birth?</i></p>


<p>For me: Knowing that there is a God is supernatural and that is all the magic in the world. Why should out-of-the-ordinary-magic (i.e.: virgin birth, and/or miracles that don't happen daily) be surprising when there is every-day-magic (i.e.: miracles that happen every day: child birth, flowers growing, power of nature...) when "The Designer" has the ability to create anything at all. For a person of faith the virgin birth is then a non-sequitur as far as being extra magical. So why then even have a virgin birth, you are probably wondering??? --- because of the nature of God. As a Catholic I believe that Mary gave birth to God. Also as a Catholic I believe that Jesus is both totally human (flawed with the limits of humanity and subject to temptations) and totally divine (perfection and without any error and without any sin). I believe in paradoxes. Believing in magic paradoxes are [sic] not a stretch for my imagination. Another answer to "why virgin birth?" is that we get used to the daily miracles. We lack the wonder we had as children Scripture says we need to be as a child to enter Heaven (Mark 10:14-15). Sometimes, at least I believe, God gives us out of the ordinary miracles to wake us up. OR to tell us: pay attention to this: this is important! So that to me is why there is the virgin birth.</p>


<p><i>Your statement: Especially given the amount of other Iron Age mythology that includes things like saviors being born from virgins or great floods ect. The closer I look at organized religion the more obvious it becomes that it is a construct of humans, not gods. </i></p>


<p>I found it interesting that you mention the amount of mythology that have flood stories... especially how you see it as evidence that religion is man-made. I feel the total opposite. I find it fascinating that different religions and bodies of people have similar stories in their beliefs even though they are from different parts of the world. I have a hard time believing that is coincidense [sic]. The fact that the details around these events are so different: to me: that is what is human. But that there was a flood? I think that was God. I also find it fascinating that the Greek god Zeus is often depicted with thunderbolts and the Jewish God of the Torah was often depicted as a cloud throwing thunder down. Zeus phenetically [sic] is close to Jesus as well... then there is the Norse god: Thor... also somewhat similar with the thunder. Anyway, I don't believe in the [sic] these mythologies (fun to read up on though) however I do feel there are some underlying truthes [sic] in all these old religions and I find the fact that the stories of such different cultures are so similar to be more of a confirmation of a god then to disprove that it is all made up by people. </p>


<p><i>Your Statement: I just find the idea of a "personal god" , watching over everyone improbable to say the least. </i></p>


<p>Non-religious folks tend knock organized religion... however I have experienced for myself great joy and small miracles because I'm a semi-religious person. The community and friendship and love make me feel this is the right place for me to be and it has been incredibly personal. Now, of course, every thing that I feel is God working in my life could possibly be explained by science or something else (which takes me back to the quote I mentioned earlier: "for those who believe no explanation is necessary, and for those who do not believe no explanation is enough") However I feel that it IS God working. One of the largest examples I have is that I have been in two major car accidents, both where the car was completely totaled, and I not only didn't have any broken bones, I also didn't have a scratch on me. Strictly statistically and scientifically speaking: I should not be alive today or for the last 5 (or more) years. But here I am, relatively healthy. Now - I have had miserable things happen to me too. And tragedies happen to wonderful people every day. I don't have an answer for that (if there is anything that I struggle with in my faith then it is the suffering in the world). I don't know why that happens, but I don't believe it is a lack of a personal God. As a Catholic I believe in many saints who were martyers [sic] and I believe in Jesus who died on a cross... and the the only consolation I can find to that... is that the story isn't over at death. :)</p>

        <title>thermite found in 911 dust</title>
        <link>2009/06/thermite-found-in-911-dust</link>
        <description><p><i>As measured using DSC, the material ignites and reacts vigorously at a temperature of approximately 430 °C, with a rather narrow exotherm, matching fairly closely an independent observation on a known super-thermite sample.</i></p>


<p>continued:</p>


<p><i>The low temperature of ignition and the presence of iron oxide grains less than 120 nm show that the material is not conventional  thermite (which ignites at temperatures above 900 °C) but very likely a form of super-thermite.</i> quoted from:</p>


<p><a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=13049" title="http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=13049">http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=13049</a></p>


<p>It is commonly known that the fires in the towers never burned hot enough or long enough to melt the steel frames within them, much less 'pulverize' the steel and allow the towers to fall at a speed within 10% of a 'free-fall'. The simplest explanation, which also fits very well with what the public saw in the news videos, is that the towers were brought down by demolition. This fits with numerous testimonies to the effect of hearing either 'numerous explosions' or 'a crackling sound' just prior the fall.</p>


<p>Now, finally, a study of dust from the site has shown the undeniable and significant presence of 'super-thermite' in all of the samples taken. So, the movement for 911 Truth can now also say that it has stronger data to support the 'controlled demolition' theory than there is to support the 'magically hot and infinitely burning jet fuel' theory. You know, seeing as we had all that evidence just sitting right there, one wonders why Rudy Giuliani recycled the 'crime-scene' steel immediately.</p>

<p>also worthy of note:</p>


<p><strong><br />
The Martha Mitchell Effect</strong></p>


<p>The Martha Mitchell effect is a process by which a belief is mistakenly diagnosed as a delusion by a psychiatrist. This is named after Martha Beall Mitchell (the wife of John Mitchell, the Attorney-General in the Nixon administration) who alleged that illegal activity was taking place in the White House. At the time her claims were thought to be signs of mental illness, and only after the Watergate scandal broke was she proved right (and hence sane).</p>

        <title>skeptics bible</title>
        <link>2009/06/skeptics-bible</link>
        <description><p>Very cool stuff. I love technology! This is one of my favorites:</p>


<p>God is rightly filled with remorse for having killed his creatures. He makes a deal with the animals, promising never to drown them all again. He even puts the rainbow in the sky so that whenever he sees it, it will remind him of his promise so that he won't be tempted to do it again. (Every time God sees the rainbow he says to himself: "Oh, yeah.... That's right. I promised not to drown the animals again. I guess I'll have to find something else to do.")</p>


<p>from Genesis 9: <a href="http://www.skepticsannotatedbible.com/gen/9.html#9" title="http://www.skepticsannotatedbible.com/gen/9.html#9">http://www.skepticsannotatedbible.com/gen/9.html#9</a></p>


<p>The mind of God is a terrifying thing - warmonger indeed.</p>


<p>or this:</p>


<p>Lot and his daughters camp out in a cave for a while. The daughters get their "just and righteous" father drunk, and have sexual intercourse with him, and each conceives and bears a son (wouldn't you know it!). Just another wholesome family values Bible story. </p>

<p>So why does the right take it's cues on sexual morality from a book that extols incest? Someone please answer that for me.</p>

"Any sufficiently advanced incompetence is indistinguishable from malice."</strong></p>


<p>which probably imitates Clarke's Third Law. Arthur C. Clarke formulated the following three "laws" of prediction:</p>


<p>   1. When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.<br />
   2. The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible.<br />
   3. Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.</p>

        <description><p>But the FDA won't tell you that.<br />

<p>It just got banned in Venezuela, for that reason:<br />

<p>So don't drink Coke Zero, or anything else with aspartame - that is, not unless you love formaldehyde buildup at the cellular level. Which you never get rid of.<br />
<i><br />
It is concluded that aspartame consumption may constitute a hazard because of its contribution to the formation of formaldehyde adducts... The fact that it accumulates with each dose, indicates grave consequences among those who consume diet drinks and foodstuffs on a daily basis.<br />
</i></p>


<p>The kicker? Our Buddy Donny 'There Are Unknown Unknowns' 'The Duck' Rumsfeld was prez of SEARLE from 1977 through the approval of aspartame. He's such a go-getter! He ignored all of the brain tumor studies, just to get it approved. We should all be very grateful. They were about to be run into the ground, and he swept in there with his politicos and cleaned it all up. More brain tumors for everyone, and mo money for Donny!</p>

<p>The timeline:</p>


<p>March 24, 1976-- Turner and Olney's petition triggers an FDA investigation of the laboratory practices of aspartame's manufacturer, G.D. Searle. The investigation finds Searle's testing procedures shoddy, full of inaccuracies and "manipulated" test data. The investigators report they "had never seen anything as bad as Searle's testing."</p>


<p>January 10, 1977-- The FDA formally requests the U.S. Attorney's office to begin grand jury proceedings to investigate whether indictments should be filed against Searle for knowingly misrepresenting findings and "concealing material facts and making false statements" in aspartame safety tests. This is the first time in the FDA's history that they request a criminal investigation of a manufacturer.</p>


<p>January 26, 1977-- While the grand jury probe is underway, Sidley &amp; Austin, the law firm representing Searle, begins job negotiations with the U.S. Attorney in charge of the investigation, Samuel Skinner.</p>


<p>March 8, 1977-- G. D. Searle hires prominent Washington insider Donald Rumsfeld as the new CEO to try to turn the beleaguered company around. A former Member of Congress and Secretary of Defense in the Ford Administration, Rumsfeld brings in several of his Washington cronies as top management.</p>


<p>July 1, 1977-- Samuel Skinner leaves the U.S. Attorney's office and takes a job with Searle's law firm. (see Jan. 26th)</p>


<p>August 1, 1977-- The Bressler Report, compiled by FDA investigators and headed by Jerome Bressler, is released. The report finds that 98 of the 196 animals died during one of Searle's studies and weren't autopsied until later dates, in some cases over one year after death. Many other errors and inconsistencies are noted. For example, a rat was reported alive, then dead, then alive, then dead again; a mass, a uterine polyp, and ovarian neoplasms were found in animals but not reported or diagnosed in Searle's reports.</p>


<p>December 8, 1977-- U.S. Attorney Skinner's withdrawal and resignation stalls the Searle grand jury investigation for so long that the statue of limitations on the aspartame charges runs out. The grand jury investigation is dropped.</p>


<p>June 1, 1979-- The FDA established a Public Board of Inquiry (PBOI) to rule on safety issues surrounding NutraSweet.</p>


<p>September 30, 1980-- The Public Board of Inquiry concludes NutraSweet should not be approved pending further investigations of brain tumors in animals. The board states it "has not been presented with proof of reasonable certainty that aspartame is safe for use as a food additive."</p>


<p>January 1981-- Donald Rumsfeld, CEO of Searle, states in a sales meeting that he is going to make a big push to get aspartame approved within the year. Rumsfeld says he will use his political pull in Washington, rather than scientific means, to make sure it gets approved. </p>


<p>And the rest is (tragic) history.</p>

        <title>the case for faith</title>
        <link>2009/06/the-case-for-faith</link>
        <description><p>Two friends who shall remain nameless had this exchange on Facebook today, and I find it to be priceless.</p>


<p>Here was the question:<br />
<i><br />
A question for my religious friends(all of you, pretty much); Isn't "faith" just a word for "I believe it because I want to"?</i></p>


<p><b>ANSWER:</b></p>


<p>I wouldn't say that belief is only "because I want to" because, at least for me, belief includes a lot of things I wouldn't mind not believing in so it isn't a matter of want. I don't want to believe that hell or the devil exists but I do... there is good stuff I believe too... but with it there is some not so fun stuff. And being Catholic there are sure a lot of sins to avoid (like dodging land mines)</p>


<p>I think the best way to explain it (and it doesn't really explain it at all) is: For those who believe no explanation is necessary and for those who do not no explanation will ever be enough. I believe because I sense a lot of magic in the world and feel that nature/science is so intricate that there is a design... anyway sorry that this was so long... but you asked ;)</p>


<p>...</p>


<p>How's that for articulate! Woohoo, case for faith made. Slam-dunk, baby.</p>


<p>point 1: 'faith' encompasses 'bad' things too, so it can't be 'just because you want to'; i.e., it's such a bitter pill to swallow, it must be a good thing.</p>


<p>point 2: The true 'case' for faith is irrational.</p>


<p>point 3: This darn world is so complicated, it must be holy - i.e., I don't understand science, so there must be a god.</p>


<p>Thanks for playing!</p>


<p>Come back next week, when we make the case for eating one's own poop.</p>


<p>...</p>


<p>p.s. I am a spiritual person and do believe in a sort of 'god', but the idea that is central to Christianity that goes something like 'there is only one true god' is what bothers me. it is this exclusionary principle that allows anti-choicers to shoot 'baby-killers' and a largely Christian US military to shoot up 'all them heretics' without compunction. This is a deeply destructive concept and has no place in the modern world. I see this apparent here in the idea that 'hell and the devil' are real, and this is seen as an 'objective truth' in the eyes of the respondent. This is dangerous because it necessarily divides her from and antagonizes her against other people in the world that decide not to believe in 'hell and the devil'.</p>


<p>Ah, the lazy mind:<br />
<i><br />
The lazy mind will not take the trouble of going to the bottom of anything; but discouraged by the first difficulties, (and every thing worth knowing is attended with some,) stops short, contents itself with easy, and consequently superficial knowledge, and prefers a great degree of ignorance to a small degree of trouble.<br />

        <title>regarding Lord Chesterfield</title>
        <link>2009/06/regarding-lord-chesterfield</link>
        <description><p>I found this awesome essay by Virginia Woolf about my man LC:</p>


<div align="justify" style="text-align:justify">
<h4>LORD CHESTERFIELD'S LETTERS TO HIS SON</h4>
<p>When Lord Mahon edited the letters of Lord Chesterfield he thought it necessary to warn the intending reader that they are “by no means fitted for early or indiscriminate perusal”. Only “those people whose understandings are fixed and whose principles are matured” can, so his Lordship said, read them with impunity. But that was in 1845. And 1845 looks a little distant now. It seems to us now the age of enormous houses without any bathrooms. Men smoke in the kitchen after the cook has gone to bed. Albums lie upon drawing-room tables. The curtains are very thick and the women are very pure. But the eighteenth century also has undergone a change. To us in 1930 it looks less strange, less remote than those early Victorian years. Its civilisation seems more rational and more complete than the civilisation of Lord Mahon and his contemporaries. Then at any rate a small group of highly educated people lived up to their ideals. If the world was smaller it was also more compact; it knew its own mind; it had its own standards. Its poetry is affected by the same security. When we read the Rape of the Lock we seem to find ourselves in an age so settled and so circumscribed that masterpieces were possible. Then, we say to ourselves, a poet could address himself whole-heartedly to his task and keep his mind upon it, so that the little boxes on a lady's dressing-table are fixed among the solid possessions of our imaginations. A game at cards or a summer's boating party upon the Thames has power to suggest the same beauty and the same sense of things vanishing that we receive from poems aimed directly at our deepest emotions. And just as the poet could spend all his powers upon a pair of scissors and a lock of hair, so too, secure in his world and its values, the aristocrat could lay down precise laws for the education of his son. In that world also there was a certainty, a security that we are now without. What with one thing and another times have changed. We can now read Lord Chesterfield's letters without blushing, or, if we do blush, we blush in the twentieth century at passages that caused Lord Mahon no discomfort whatever.</p>
<p>When the letters begin, Philip Stanhope, Lord Chesterfield's natural son by a Dutch governess, was a little boy of seven. And if we are to make any complaint against the father's moral teaching, it is that the standard is too high for such tender years. “Let us return to oratory, or the art of speaking well; which should never be entirely out of our thoughts”, he writes to the boy of seven. “A man can make no figure without it in Parliament, or the Church, or in the law”, he continues, as if the little boy were already considering his career. It seems, indeed, that the father's fault, if fault it be, is one common to distinguished men who have not themselves succeeded as they should have done and are determined to give their children—and Philip was an only child—the chances that they have lacked. Indeed, as the letters go on one may suppose that Lord Chesterfield wrote as much to amuse himself by turning over the stores of his experience, his reading, his knowledge of the world, as to instruct his son. The letters show an eagerness, an animation, which prove that to write to Philip was not a task, but a delight. Tired, perhaps, with the duties of office and disillusioned with its disappointments, he takes up his pen and, in the relief of free communication at last, forgets that his correspondent is, after all, only a schoolboy who cannot understand half the things that his father says to him. But, even so, there is nothing to repel us in Lord Chesterfield's preliminary sketch of the unknown world. He is all on the side of moderation, toleration, ratiocination. Never abuse whole bodies of people, he counsels; frequent all churches, laugh at none; inform yourself about all things. Devote your mornings to study, your evenings to good society. Dress as the best people dress, behave as they behave, never be eccentric, egotistical, or absent-minded. Observe the laws of proportion, and live every moment to the full.</p>
<p>So, step by step, he builds up the figure of the perfect man—the man that Philip may become, he is persuaded, if he will only—and here Lord Chesterfield lets fall the words which are to colour his teaching through and through—cultivate the Graces. These ladies are, at first, kept discreetly in the background. It is well that the boy should be indulged in fine sentiments about women and poets to begin with. Lord Chesterfield adjures him to respect them both. “For my own part, I used to think myself in company as much above me when I was with Mr. Addison and Mr. Pope, as if I had been with all the Princes in Europe”, he writes. But as time goes on the Virtues are more and more taken for granted. They can be left to take care of themselves. But the Graces assume tremendous proportions. The Graces dominate the life of man in this world. Their service cannot for an instant be neglected. And the service is certainly exacting. For consider what it implies, this art of pleasing. To begin with, one must know how to come into a room and then how to go out again. As human arms and legs are notoriously perverse, this by itself is a matter needing considerable dexterity. Then one must be dressed so that one's clothes seem perfectly fashionable without being new or striking; one's teeth must be perfect; one's wig beyond reproach; one's finger-nails cut in the segment of a circle; one must be able to carve, able to dance, and, what is almost as great an art, able to sit gracefully in a chair. These things are the alphabet of the art of pleasing. We now come to speech. It is necessary to speak at least three languages to perfection. But before we open our lips we must take a further precaution—we must be on our guard never to laugh. Lord Chesterfield himself never laughed. He always smiled. When at length the young man is pronounced capable of speech he must avoid all proverbs and vulgar expressions; he must enunciate clearly and use perfect grammar; he must not argue; he must not tell stories; he must not talk about himself. Then, at last, the young man may begin to practise the finest of the arts of pleasing—the art of flattery. For every man and every woman has some prevailing vanity. Watch, wait, pry, seek out their weakness, “and you will then know what to bait your hook with to catch them”. For that is the secret of success in the world.</p>
<p>It is at this point, such is the idiosyncrasy of our age, that we begin to feel uneasy. Lord Chesterfield's views upon success are far more questionable than his views upon love. For what is to be the prize of this endless effort and self-abnegation? What do we gain when we have learnt to come into rooms and to go out again; to pry into people's secrets; to hold our tongues and to flatter, to forsake the society of low-born people which corrupts and the society of clever people which perverts? What is the prize which is to reward us? It is simply that we shall rise in the world. Press for a further definition, and it amounts perhaps to this: one will be popular with the best people. But if we are so exacting as to demand who the best people are we become involved in a labyrinth from which there is no returning. Nothing exists in itself. What is good society? It is the society that the best people believe to be good. What is wit? It is what the best people think to be witty. All value depends upon somebody else's opinion. For it is the essence of this philosophy that things have no independent existence, but live only in the eyes of other people. It is a looking-glass world, this, to which we climb so slowly; and its prizes are all reflections. That may account for our baffled feeling as we shuffle, and shuffle vainly, among these urbane pages for something hard to lay our hands upon. Hardness is the last thing we shall find. But, granted the deficiency, how much that is ignored by sterner moralists is here seized upon, and who shall deny, at least while Lord Chesterfield's enchantment is upon him, that these imponderable qualities have their value and these shining Graces have their radiance? Consider for a moment what the Graces have done for their devoted servant, the Earl.</p>
<p>Here is a disillusioned politician, who is prematurely aged, who has lost his office, who is losing his teeth, who, worst fate of all, is growing deafer day by day. Yet he never allows a groan to escape him. He is never dull; he is never boring; he is never slovenly. His mind is as well groomed as his body. Never for a second does he “welter in an easy-chair”. Private though these letters are, and apparently spontaneous, they play with such ease in and about the single subject which absorbs them that it never becomes tedious or, what is still more remarkable, never becomes ridiculous. It may be that the art of pleasing has some connection with the art of writing. To be polite, considerate, controlled, to sink one's egotism, to conceal rather than to obtrude one's personality, may profit the writer even as they profit the man of fashion.</p>
<p>Certainly there is much to be said in favour of the training, however we define it, which helped Lord Chesterfield to write his Characters. The little papers have the precision and formality of some old-fashioned minuet. Yet the symmetry is so natural to the artist that he can break it where he likes; it never becomes pinched and formal, as it would in the hands of an imitator. He can be sly; he can be witty; he can be sententious, but never for an instant does he lose his sense of time, and when the tune is over he calls a halt. “Some succeeded, and others burst” he says of George the First's mistresses: the King liked them fat. Again, “He was fixed in the house of lords, that hospital of incurables.” He smiles: he does not laugh. Here the eighteenth century, of course, came to his help. Lord Chesterfield, though he was polite to everything, even to the stars and Bishop Berkeley's philosophy, firmly refused, as became a son of his age, to dally with infinity or to suppose that things are not quite as solid as they seem. The world was good enough and the world was big enough as it was. This prosaic temper, while it keeps him within the bounds of impeccable common sense, limits his outlook. No single phrase of his reverberates or penetrates as so many of La Bruyère's do. But he would have been the first to deprecate any comparison with that great writer; besides, to write as La Bruyère wrote, one must perhaps believe in something, and then how difficult to observe the Graces! One might perhaps laugh; one might perhaps cry. Both are equally deplorable.</p>
<p>But while we amuse ourselves with this brilliant nobleman and his views on life we are aware, and the letters owe much of their fascination to this consciousness, of a dumb yet substantial figure on the farther side of the page. Philip Stanhope is always there. It is true that he says nothing, but we feel his presence in Dresden, in Berlin, in Paris, opening the letters and poring over them and looking dolefully at the thick packets which have been accumulating year after year since he was a child of seven. He had grown into a rather serious, rather stout, rather short young man. He had a taste for foreign politics. A little serious reading was rather to his liking. And by every post the letters came—urbane, polished, brilliant, imploring and commanding him to learn to dance, to learn to carve, to consider the management of his legs, and to seduce a lady of fashion. He did his best. He worked very hard in the school of the Graces, but their service was too exacting. He sat down half-way up the steep stairs which lead to the glittering hall with all the mirrors. He could not do it. He failed in the House of Commons; he subsided into some small post in Ratisbon; he died untimely. He left it to his widow to break the news which he had lacked the heart or the courage to tell his father—that he had been married all these years to a lady of low birth, who had borne him children.</p>
<p>The Earl took the blow like a gentleman. His letter to his daughter-inlaw is a model of urbanity. He began the education of his grandsons. But he seems to have become a little indifferent to what happened to himself after that. He did not care greatly if he lived or died. But still to the very end he cared for the Graces. His last words were a tribute of respect to those goddesses. Someone came into the room when he was dying; he roused himself: “Give Dayrolles a chair,” he said, and said no more.</p>

        <title>I will not write about Idol</title>
        <link>2009/05/i-will-not-write-about-idol</link>
        <description><p>I will not write about American Idol. This post will not be about Adam Lambert or Paula Abdul or whatever.</p>


<p>I say this because I have never watched it. Never, not once. Some of you may gasp. It is easy for me to say this, because there is no 'television' in my apartment, per se, although I do get my Hulu on occasionally.</p>


<p>Anyway, the reason I'm talking about American Idol is simple - it is because yesterday, one of top the top 10 trending 'twopics' on Twitter was '#SaveEarl', which came about because whichever network (NBC?) carries My Name is Earl decided to drop it, and noooo, the Twitterverse can't have that. So we had thousands of voices yesterday waxing victimized about it; it was quite a sight. Whereupon, I decided to write </p>


<p>#saveearl screw Earl save Aung San <a href="http://www.burmacampaign.org.uk/mtvaction.html" title="http://www.burmacampaign.org.uk/mtvaction.html">http://www.burmacampaign.org.uk/mtvaction.html</a> #burma #SuuKyi</p>


<p>and I didn't get a lot of love.</p>


<p>My point was that if this much otherwise unused energy can be harnessed so easily to 'Save Earl', as they say, maybe someone somewhere can appreciate the devilish irony that this kind of activity is always necessarily irrelevant. If it were to involve something meaningful like putting real political pressure on our own government to weigh in more heavily on the Aung San Suu Kyi issue, then 99% of our sedated community would gloss over and start looking for America Idol - which itself is not news.</p>


<p>I think the story of our generation is now beginning to be "How the hell can we break our addiction to oil?", and that is a good thing. I think it should also be "How the hell can we break our addiction to television?", because I guarantee they go hand in hand. I will even go one further - we've heard a lot of talk about this lack of morality on Wall street; we as taxpayers were deliberately sodomized repeatedly, after which we were told that it was for our own good. This pattern continues.</p>


<p>I've also heard that daydreaming actually allows the subconscious brain to resolve inner issues of morality and deep emotional connection building, relative to the recent past, as if when left alone the subconscious starts making sense out of disparate 'stuff' from that day.</p>


<p>We also know that brain activity levels are at their lowest when someone is watching TV; the subconscious is not free at that point to do anything, it is functionally shackled.</p>


<p>So my final point is this - we will not fix Wall Street, nor will we harness the populist power of the middle and working classes, until everyone gets rid of their television and starts daydreaming.</p>


<p>A lot.</p>


<p>There's flies in the kitchen<br />
I can hear them a-buzzin'<br />
and I ain't done nothing<br />
since I woke up today<br />
how can a person<br />
go to work in the morning<br />
come home in the evening<br />
and have nothing to say?</p>

        <title>Follow me Friday and music monday</title>
        <link>2009/05/follow-me-friday-and-music-monday</link>
        <description><p>Aww, isn't Twitter cute?</p>


<p>So far, I have noticed:<br />
MusicMonday, as in -<br />
#musicmonday this song rocks! </p>


<p>and FollowFriday, as in -<br />
#followfriday @myfriend has the mad links, yo!</p>


<p>It reminds me a bit of what would happen if we were all still in kindergarten, which then reminds me of those NYU kids who held up their own cafeteria last Fall - you know, what happens when no one is in charge, except everyone is. Which means trending topics (twopics) are subject to the lemming law, which is to say that in an echo chamber you can't count votes and think they are unique.</p>


<p>The lemming law meaning: in the Twitterverse, anyone and everyone is happy to follow anyone else off a cliff. The cliff of deliberate propaganda, or the cliff of general collective foolishness, or the cliff of faux outrage.</p>


<p>So what's next? troubledtuesday, where everyone vents their woes...<br />
#troubledtuesday ah, the angst of it all!</p>


<p>or even Wacky Wednesday?<br />
#wackywed I'm too sexy for my keyboard...</p>


<p>Don't get me started on the weekends.</p>

        <title>cs engineer versus the philosopher</title>
        <link>2009/05/cs-engineer-versus-the-philosopher</link>
        <description><p>Having once participated in a week-long workshop comprising both philosophers and computer scientists, one difference in disciplinary style quickly became evident: Faced with a description of a new application domain or problem, a typical computer scientist immediately thinks:</p>


<p>    How can I simplify this problem or abstract away from some of the details of its description, in order to make progress towards solving it?</p>


<p>    while a typical philosopher immediately thinks:</p>


<p>    What implicit assumptions have been made or distinctions overlooked in this problem description, which need to be articulated, analyzed and discussed before we start to tackle it?</p>


<p>   Needless to say, these different disciplinary styles themselves became the subject of discussion by some of the philosophers present, much to the annoyance of the computer scientists!</p>

        <title>comment response from Matt Taibbi article</title>
        <link>2009/05/comment-response-from-matt-taibbi-article</link>
        <description><p>quote from the article:</p>


<p>It's the same thing with this torture business. There are a lot of people in this country who genuinely believe that torture opponents are “not upset” about things like 9/11 or the beheading of American hostages. The idea that “no one complains when Americans are murdered” is crazy — of course we “complained,” and of course we'd all like to round up those machete-wielding monsters and shoot them into space — but these people really believe this, they really believe that torture opponents are secretly unimpressed/untroubled by Islamic terrorism, at least as compared to American “enhanced interrogation.” For them to believe that, they must really believe that such people are traitors, nursing a secret agenda (an agenda perhaps unknown even to themselves, their America-hatred being ingrained so deep) against their own country. Which is really an amazing thing for large numbers of Americans to believe about another large group of Americans, when you think about it.<br />
&lt;!--break--><br />
and the comment by 'kaote':</p>


<p>You're absolutely right, they do "believe" thinking, genuinely principled Americans are traitors. It's also interesting to note that these torture zealots are also the people that obsess the most about so-called "values" which seem to be arbitrarily selected from the most irrelevant, none-of-your-business aspects of morality they can find (most of them sexual, which says something about these people as well).</p>


<p>The scarequotes around believe, though, are necessary, because we Americans who are capable of thought have a different notion of what that word actually entails. When we believe something, it's the direct result of having gathered the facts, applied logic and reason to them, and come to a defensible conclusion. Their beliefs are entirely different animals that, as you note, seem to bubble up from their unconscious and then grasp wildly for some sort of explanation that pitifully mocks logic, which makes you wonder which came first, religion or the swarms of retarded non-thinkers.</p>


<p>The paranoia and fear-based conspiratorialism they apply to everything political (and often refer to as "The Culture Wars") appeals to their macho, us vs. them gut response, and the gut is where we should do all of our thinking, just ask Glenn Beck. They're so used to "thinking" this way and being agreed with by their backwater compatriots that they've never really considered that they could be wrong, hence their rage when some intellectual asshole comes along and effortlessly dismisses them with high-falutin' rational thinking.</p>


<p>This is how we get stuck in "debates" about non-issues that often break out along geographical lines, with the least educated, most gut-checking types almost always to the right of the issue. We, the thinking, let them push us into debates about things that are so obvious you wouldn't think we needed to discuss them at all, like the fact that creationism has nothing to do with science. These are factual matters, and even though we're talking about morality in this case, you would think that just pushing them to be consistent would be enough to reach agreement. They don't even realize that they're undermining their own notion of morality, which is usually seen to be deontological, not consequentialist like Krauthammer's. You can't believe people to be inherently evil while also holding the belief that your actions can be defended based on the results. I know, I know, way beyond anything they want to consider...</p>


<p>But they're not really interested in being logical or consistent. Quite frankly, they don't know how to be. They're interested in being "right", whether by force of argument or repetition.</p>


<p>I should add (and I'm quite sure the reader is aware) that the "liberals" do this shit, too. There, fair and balanced.</p>

        <title>more priceless commentary from the blogosphere</title>
        <link>2009/05/more-priceless-commentary-from-the-blogosphere</link>
        <description><p>Where did this idea come from that NPR is "liberal"? Are we talking Phil Ochs's definition, "five degrees left of center mostly, but ten degrees right of center when it affects them personally"? I hope so, because that's the only sense of "liberal" I can see applying to NPR. During eight years of the worst presidency in history, they bent so far over backwards to be "fair" to the Bushies that they were usually left chewing on their own pubic hair.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.wfmu.org/freeform/2009/04/ten-things-i-hate-about-npr.html" title="http://blog.wfmu.org/freeform/2009/04/ten-things-i-hate-about-npr.html">http://blog.wfmu.org/freeform/2009/04/ten-things-i-hate-about-npr.html</a></p>


<p>Phil Ochs lyrics for reference:</p>


<p>I cried when they shot Medgar Evers<br />
Tears ran down my spine<br />
I cried when they shot Mr. Kennedy<br />
As though I'd lost a father of mine<br />
But Malcolm X got what was coming<br />
He got what he asked for this time<br />
So love me, love me, love me, I'm a liberal</p>


<p>I go to civil rights rallies<br />
And I put down the old D.A.R.<br />
I love Harry and Sidney and Sammy<br />
I hope every colored boy becomes a star<br />
But don't talk about revolution<br />
That's going a little bit too far<br />
So love me, love me, love me, I'm a liberal</p>


<p>I cheered when Humphrey was chosen<br />
My faith in the system restored<br />
I'm glad the commies were thrown out<br />
of the A.F.L. C.I.O. board<br />
I love Puerto Ricans and Negros<br />
as long as they don't move next door<br />
So love me, love me, love me, I'm a liberal</p>


<p>The people of old Mississippi<br />
Should all hang their heads in shame<br />
I can't understand how their minds work<br />
What's the matter don't they watch Les Crain?<br />
But if you ask me to bus my children<br />
I hope the cops take down your name<br />
So love me, love me, love me, I'm a liberal</p>


<p>I read New republic and Nation<br />
I've learned to take every view<br />
You know, I've memorized Lerner and Golden<br />
I feel like I'm almost a Jew<br />
But when it comes to times like Korea<br />
There's no one more red, white and blue<br />
So love me, love me, love me, I'm a liberal</p>


<p>I vote for the democratic party<br />
They want the U.N. to be strong<br />
I go to all the Pete Seeger concerts<br />
He sure gets me singing those songs<br />
I'll send all the money you ask for<br />
But don't ask me to come on along<br />
So love me, love me, love me, I'm a liberal</p>


<p>Once I was young and impulsive<br />
I wore every conceivable pin<br />
Even went to the socialist meetings<br />
Learned all the old union hymns<br />
But I've grown older and wiser<br />
And that's why I'm turning you in<br />
So love me, love me, love me, I'm a liberal</p>

        <title>Obamas hatchet man Geithner</title>
        <link>2009/04/obamas-hatchet-man-geithner</link>
        <description><p>There is some good domestic money in the 'rescue package' - but most of it is still secretly lining the pockets of Citigroup. Let us make no mistake - I had a discussion about this yesterday - our financial system is still crumbling, and Obama has TOTALLY sided with the banks. He is only OCCASIONALLY a champion of the people.</p>


<p>Where is the mortgage relief for homeowners? Why is our government paying top dollar for toxic assets, essentially using tax dollars to keep criminal banking interests solvent? Why is the war still growing? Why do banks get bailed out over and over, while auto workers are SOL?</p>


<p>And finally, why are a million people still declaring bankruptcy every year because they can't afford to pay their health care bills? Where is a people's champion for that?</p>


<p>quoted:</p>


<p>Geithner has since pushed the Obama administration to approach the banking crisis not in response to the needs of destitute homeowners but rather from the side of the bankers who are seizing their homes. Instead of keeping people in their homes with a freeze on foreclosures, he has rewarded the unscrupulous lenders who conned ordinary folks.</p>


<p>He still wants to give more money to Citigroup, which has just been found woefully short of cash by Treasury's auditors, and has not stopped Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and some other big banks ostensibly under government influence, and indeed sometimes ownership, from recently ending their temporary moratoriums on housing foreclosures. Geithner has been in the forefront of coddling the banks in the hopes that welfare for the rich will trickle down to suffering homeowners, but that has not happened.</p>

        <title>Living Life Forwards by David Post</title>
        <link>2009/04/living-life-forwards-by-david-post</link>
        <description><p>There's a good reason that generals, as the saying goes, are always fighting the last war. It's the same reason the drunk looks for his lost keys under the streetlight rather than in the dark alley where he actually dropped them: The light's better there. We won't find our keys, and we won't learn how to fight the next war - but what else can we do? It's just as Kierkegaard said - we live forward, but can only understand backward. That's just part of the human condition, the way the world is constructed.</p>

<p>Also, for the record, I think public spending is in essence a good thing. We just have to be careful about political pork, which is what I think this touches on - also, I think the parallel here with the Patriot Act is striking.</p>

        <title>Open Arms</title>
        <link>2009/04/Open-Arms</link>
        <description><p>It was all for you<br />
The long expensive road to nothing new<br />
These unappreciated lines for you<br />
Falling on this tough love crowd, it's true<br />
I did it all for you<br />
Open arms<br />
There's nothing better than those ample charms<br />
Somewhere waiting for the world to start<br />
Somehow afflicted by a broken heart<br />
Looking for those open arms</p>


<p>When I was a prince of the world<br />
All I had was a long list of words<br />
All I saw I could touch with my hands<br />
All I needed was<br />
All I needed was a chance</p>


<p>Those days are gone<br />
I think I see your yesterdays moved on<br />
They left behind that dirty smile you've got<br />
Younger than your timeless ways<br />
Your yesterdays<br />
I know all your tricks<br />
I know the way your heart can hurt like this<br />
I hate the way my plan can miss like this<br />
But there's no changing what my future is<br />
I know all your tricks</p>


<p>When I was ahead of it all<br />
And I could see what was coming along<br />
Everybody knew the way to get home, but me<br />
All I needed was<br />
All I needed was a dream</p>

        <title>words to weighty ghost by wintersleep</title>
        <link>2009/04/words-to-weighty-ghost-by-wintersleep</link>
        <description><p>I got out of bed today<br />
swear to god I couldn&#039;t see my face<br />
I got out of bed today<br />
staring at a ghost<br />
who forgot to float away<br />
didn&#039;t have all that much to say<br />
wouldn&#039;t even tell me his own name<br />
and where&#039;d my body go<br />
oh where&#039;d my body go<br />
africa or mexico<br />
where&#039;d my body go<br />
where&#039;d my body go<br />
oh have you seen my ghost<br />
staring at the ground<br />
oh have you seen my ghost<br />
sick of them goddam clouds</p>


<p>are you some kind of medicine man<br />
get the demons out of my head<br />
you can&#039;t kill the thing that&#039;s already dead<br />
so leave my soul alone<br />
don&#039;t need no surgery<br />
take those knives away from me<br />
just want to die in my own body<br />
a ghost just needs a home</p>

        <title>good stuff on remote rsync</title>
        <link>2009/04/good-stuff-on-remote-rsync</link>
        <description><p>Making remote copies</p>


<p>What if you want to copy files offsite to a remote host? No problem -- all you need to do is add the host and user information. So, for instance, if you want to copy the same directory to a remote host, you&#039;d use:</p>


<p>rsync -avhe ssh --delete /home/user/dir/ user@remote.host.com:dir/</p>


<p>If you want to know how fast the transfer is going, and how much remains to be copied, add the --progress option:</p>


<p>rsync --progress -avhe ssh --delete /home/user/dir/ user@remote.host.com:dir/</p>


<p>If you don&#039;t want to be prompted for a password each time rsync makes a connection -- and you don&#039;t -- make sure that you have rsync set up to log in using an SSH key rather than a password. To do this, create an SSH key on the local machine using ssh-keygen -t dsa, and press Enter when prompted for a passphrase. After the key is created, use ssh-copy-id -i .ssh/id_dsa.pub <a href="mailto:user@remote.host.com">user@remote.host.com</a> to copy the public key to the remote host.</p>


<p>What if you need to bring back some of the files you copied using rsync? Use the following syntax:</p>


<p>rsync -avze ssh remote.host.com:/home/user/dir/ /local/path/</p>


<p>The z option compresses data during the transfer. If the file you are copying exists on the local host, then rsync will just leave it alone -- the same as if you were copying files to a remote host.<br />
Wrapping it up with a script</p>


<p>Once you&#039;ve figured out what directory or directories you want to sync up, and you&#039;ve gotten the commands you need to sync everything, it&#039;s easy to wrap it all up with a simple script. Here&#039;s a short sample:</p>


<p>rsync --progress -avze ssh --delete /home/user/bin/ user@remote.host.com:bin/<br />
rsync --progress -avze ssh --delete /home/user/local/data/ user@remote.host.com:local/data/<br />
rsync --progress -avze ssh --delete /home/user/.tomboy/ user@remote.host.com:/.tomboy/</p>


<p>also remember to to use the --dry-run option with your commands</p>


<p>** good stuff on remote rsync **</p>

        <description><p>I left my broken down in Texas<br />
the road has never felt so long<br />
along the way I start to wonder<br />
who will miss me when I&#039;m gone?</p>


<p>if you don&#039;t mind waiting<br />
for the news to break<br />
before you turn away<br />

<p>Some say there&#039;s nothing after dying<br />
that all we have is in this world<br />
I don&#039;t know much about tomorrow<br />
but right now I feel pretty good</p>


<p>if you don&#039;t mind waiting<br />
for the drugs to take<br />
before you turn away<br />
before you turn away<br />
if you don&#039;t mind waiting<br />
for the drugs to take<br />

<p>it&#039;s a life worth saving<br />
and a chance worth taking<br />

Subject: Re: Lost! Tiny blue hat on Carroll St. betw. 8th Ave. &amp; PPW</p>


<p>And yet, she did say "infant's" hat. Why? Is there something ineffably "infant-ish" about the hat? And if the hat is worn by, say, a 9-month old with an unusually small head, does that mean there's something wrong or evil about that 9-month old? Who are we to judge that a hat is "for" an "infant"? What gives us the right to even slap it with the label "hat," when for all we know it's a very soft, porous bowl, or a cozy for a tiny soccer ball? It's throwaway comments like "infant's hat" that hurt me to the quick. </p>

        <link>2009/04/lyrics-to-All-Tied-Up</link>
        <description><p>All tied up<br />
Nowhere left to go but down<br />
Turn your world around<br />
Burning down the house<br />
when everything goes south<br />
Change your state<br />
Find a place to go away<br />
Try to love again<br />
Choice is not a sin<br />
Try to let me in</p>


<p>I know you're hurt<br />
I know you're hurt</p>


<p>We take what's good and we take what's right<br />
We break our toys and don't think twice<br />
We hold our breath and we don't know why<br />
Now it's over<br />
it's over<br />
has it changed so much since the day we were born?<br />
Because I feel so much is all but gone<br />
So I hold my breath and I don't look back<br />
Now it's over<br />
it's over<br />
it's over now</p>


<p>All tied up<br />
Something in my head won't budge<br />
I'm changing all my ways<br />
Counting up the days<br />
The ones we didn't hate<br />
It's over now<br />
And so we say again<br />
You're out and someone else is in<br />
We don't know where they've been<br />
But choice is not a sin</p>

        <title>and now we can talk about it</title>
        <link>2009/04/and-now-we-can-talk-about-it</link>
        <description><p>Well, the one good thing I'm getting out of this redesign is that I can dump all of these posts out into the vast night and no one will see them. And so I am able to see how this whole thing shakes out.</p>


<p>I will tell the story, fully hoping that no one will read it, as a strange testament to what gives me pleasure as well as a good example of how sweet technology is.</p>


<p>As some of you know, I make my living as a software developer. It's been about ten years now that I spend about ten dollars for every dollar I make as a songwriter in the process of making songs. The return is there, but without some good seed capital it feels a little like blowing on an ember with your nose. But I digress.<br />
So there I was, growing up as a rockstar and office whore. Trying to make a statement. It was about 8 years ago that both I moved here and I decided to live two lives. I only mention this because I am now announcing that this double life is over. I have married both of my blogs to each other just as I soon will marry my beloved and thus I am saying 'Yes, it may be that I will post both song lyrics and code snippets; I may be both rockstar and nerd and that is just the way of it.'</p>


<p>And so it is. My weird 'why is the server called digbox if the site says codeboxer?' days are over. There will be one server to rule them all.</p>


<p>Hehe, so anyway to finish the story I was trying to consolidate and had some problems moving my 'nerd' blog over to the mothership, so to speak, and finally the light went off. This Drupal 6 is sort of the bomb. Why don't I dump that crappy b2Evolution installation that won't port nicely and just drive all of my posts from TheAxelVault (aka kristeraxel.com)? </p>


<p>So then I'm looking for a way to export b2Evolution and I see that there isn't one. I stumble across a blog post that suggests 'why not just set up a view to aggregate everything you want dumped as an rss feed and do it that way?'</p>


<p>And I say, yeah, why not? Great idea.</p>


<p>So my posts don't look as good as they used to because they got sucked through the SimplePie rss machine but they are there. I did the same thing with my podcast posts. Now I post everything from here, and it shoots out to the appropriate feed lickety split.</p>


<p>But here's the kicker. I used these 2 php libraries (class_http.php and class_xml.php) that I got here <a href="http://www.troywolf.com/articles/php/class_http/" title="http://www.troywolf.com/articles/php/class_http/">http://www.troywolf.com/articles/php/class_http/</a> and I built my own server-side search parser, totally simple and barebones, and it's a self-updating site now. I set up the feed through google and I use the little google script to populate the home page (cached every 60 minutes). The only other page is the search page and it takes search parameters from the GET, sets up it's own little hardcoded tag dictionary on the fly for menu items, and hits the (also cached) rss feed for every search, slices up the xml file according to your search tag, and serves it up. I'm so proud I keep messing with it.</p>


<p>for those who have no idea what I just said, I basically replaced a whole blog site that I used to have to maintain with 2 simple pages that update and search themselves on their own - based on posts that I drive from this site. Talk about simplifying your life!</p>


<p>The only downside is that it will probably kill some old links, but hey, such is life.</p>


<p>check it out at <a href="http://codeboxer.com/" title="http://codeboxer.com/">http://codeboxer.com/</a></p>


<p>*** and now we can talk about it ***</p>

<td align='justify'>
<p>It has been so long since I wrote a blog post.</p>
<p>I used to fill up a whole book per year with  poems and lyrics and such but then when I was in college they invented this thing called the personal computer and I ended up staying in the library all night to use my first email address. And then I bought my own computer. Then I got a laptop.</p>
<p>Now I am sending tweets from my phone that auto post to Facebook and my own website. Soon I will have it so I can email in posts from anywhere. Somewhere along the line I stopped blogging as much, because like mostly every songwriter/geek right now I have a bunch of social profiles to keep updating and it's not as much about writing anymore as it is about <em>connecting</em> what you write. Yikes.</p>
<p>Anyway, I have a gig coming up finally. I think my last one was in November. I sent out an email recently (<a href="http://campaign-archive.com/?u=29744d054bf577181511e20e9&amp;id=c1510a0736" target="_blank">link</a>), and I'm shuffling around my web sites like it's going out of style. I'm still looking to possibly move Ruby hosts, I have done pretty well so far with the ghetto-ish <a href="http://railsplayground.com/" target="_blank">RailsPlayground</a> but I will need to upgrade soon. Other than that, I am dropping both NamesDirect and Hostmonster for a fully centralized account at Dreamhost, and so far I'm pretty happy with it. Dreamhost does leave you out in the cold a little on the support side, but that's why I've been contracting out a little php work lately and it's been working pretty well. Php labor is pretty cheap these days, and I pay my guys well (no matter what they do - from php devs all the way up to studio cats that I bring in for my album projects) so it is all working out famously.</p>
<p>And of course, my peeps at <a href="http://gmg-entertainment.com" target="_blank">GMG</a> are taking good care of me. I got a wedding coming up, dontcha know.</p>

<p>This week has been all about the SQL. Here is some fun I had with it. This is dynamic sql, and you are seeing the end product - this was originally built as a find_by_sql call, and of course had bind variables that you don&#039;t see here - but you get the idea.</p>

<p>If you see a camera or microphone, be careful not to be trampled by a politician rushing to shout their 'outrage' at AIG, and its brazen scheme to pay $165 million in bonuses to employees at the company unit responsible for driving the company to the edge of insolvency.</p>
<p>Maybe the politicians really are outraged. (They definitely know their constituents are.) But it would have helped if they had expressed some outrage - and opposition - during the decades-long period of deregulation that brought us the AIG collapse and the financial meltdown.</p>
<p>It is indeed unfathomable that AIG went ahead with the bonus payments, and that the Treasury Department and Federal Reserve failed to act to stop the bonus payments before they were made.</p>
<p>What is vital now is that the public‚s righteous anger is not expressed only as 'no.' There are a lot of things to which We The People do need to say 'no.' But we need a lot of 'yes' too. We need to demand that policymakers impose public controls over the financial sector. The financial sector restraint, shrinkage and displacement agenda is long and diverse, but there are a number of lessons that flow directly from the AIG debacle.</p>
<p>First, the government must exercise much more direct control over the firms it is bailing out (many of which, like AIG, are very likely to be subjected to government takeovers of one kind or another in the coming months). If the government exercised control commensurate with its ownership stake, it could simply refuse to permit outrages like the AIG bonus payments to occur. Beyond preventing outrages, there should be affirmative demands imposed on the beneficiaries of bailout funds. These should include, for commercial banks, the mandatory write down of principal on home mortgages where the outstanding loan amount now exceed the value of the home, and the end to usurious interest rates on credit cards.</p>
<p>Second, there must be far-reaching reform of compensation arrangements in the financial sector. Never again should anyone get away with saying this is a symbolic issue. The AIG bonus payments, and the manic response from the financial sector to modest executive pay restrictions added by Senator Chris Dodd to the financial bailout reauthorization legislation, demonstrate that the guys on Wall Street certainly don‚t think it‚s symbolic. Real reform must go beyond giving shareholders a say on pay to imposing public controls. There should be high tax rates on excessive compensation. Most importantly, there should be a prohibition on incentive pay that is linked to short-term performance. Bonuses based on annual performance give traders and others an incentive to take unreasonable risks - threatening the viability of their firms, and the overall financial system.</p>
<p>Third, the regulatory black holes in the financial system must be eradicated. One black hole concerns regulation of financial derivatives - the exotic instruments that threw AIG into virtual insolvency. During the Clinton administration, Fed Chair Alan Greenspan, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Deputy Treasury Secretary (now director of the National Economic Council) Larry Summers crushed an effort by independent-minded regulators to adopt modest regulation of financial derivatives. In 2000, Congress prohibited such regulation by law. When regulations are finally adopted this year, as they almost certainly will be, they should prohibit certain kinds of financial derivatives altogether, and require that new ones prove their safety and social value before being placed on the market.</p>
<p>Fourth, we need a revitalized antitrust and competition policy to break up and shrink the size of the mega financial institutions (and, not so incidentally, we also need to shrink the size of the overall financial structure). These too-big-to-fail institutions are, as has been said, just too big. Or amended: they are too big and too interconnected. Their very existence poses unacceptable social costs, made worse by the fact they take greater risks knowing that they benefit from an implicit public insurance.</p>
<p>AIG itself has acknowledged the problem. In a company presentation apparently prepared to persuade the federal government to keep the bailout funds coming, AIG explained, 'what happens to AIG has the potential to trigger a cascading set of further failures which cannot be stopped except by extraordinary means.'</p>
<p>AIG CEO Edward Liddy has drawn the proper conclusion: 'Where safeguards are lacking' - and it should be added, it has proven far beyond the capacity of regulators to impose sufficient safeguards - 'such companies need to be restructured or scaled back so they no longer come close to posing a systemic risk.'</p>
<p>Finally, renewed attention must be paid to corporate structure and prohibitions on whole categories of activity. Insurance companies should be prohibited from operating affiliates that function as de facto hedge funds. Commercial banks husbanding depositors‚ assets should be prohibited from operating securities firms (as was law until 1999) or making securities firm-style speculative bets.</p>
<p>Will the outraged politicians demand these and other reforms? Will their outrage last once the media move on to the next story? That will depend almost entirely on whether an organized and focused public demands it.</p>

        <title>I got some sync for u right here</title>
        <link>2009/03/i-got-some-sync-for-u-right-here</link>
        <description><table cellpadding="5">
<tr style="background-color:#ddd;">
<td align='justify'>
<p>Well, this is sort of a test post but it is definitely a think piece. :)</p>
<p>It started when I decided to try to start syncing up all of my 'posts'. That led me to Twitter, which then led me to ping.fm, and of course the google reader has been part and parcel of this all along the way.</p>
<p>The other piece is my home page at kristeraxel.com, which I use to drive posts and to keep my content under my own umbrella. For example, my sister has a beautiful blog over at blogspot, but I wonder what will ever happen if they go under or get bought, I just hate not having control like that. Ditto for pictures, even video. It kills me that people fall over themselves to hand their content to the Flickrs and the Youtubes of the world, when you can pay like $60 a year to keep all your shit to yourself. Hold on to your content, people! Privacy is a big deal too, but it's the short sightedness that gets me. Is anyone backing anything up, or is this generation literally handing itself over, one anecdotal reference at a time, to big business for prompt monetization and eventual subversion? I can see a future where you have to pay YouTube to give you back a copy of the video you uploaded. They'll call it an 'administration fee', and it will probably be more than the 6 bucks per month or so that you have to pay to get a real host with unlimited storage.</p>
<p>But I digress. So here's what is going on:</p>
<p>My Drupal site is linked to Twitter. Twitter posts show up here, and posts on my Drupal site (kristeraxel.com) get auto-synopsized into a Twitter post. Cool!<br />
Those Twitter posts feed into my google reader for easy reference.</p>
<p>I used to have my Facebook account tied to my google reader feed (stay with me here) so that any article I flag to 'share' will pop up as a micro post in FB; but that didn't work too well because the Notes module had this habit of tying all posts in one day into a single 'omni' post, which was not cool. So now, I have tied my FB notes module to my Twitter feed, and I will see if the Twitter updates that get generated from my Drupal site will shoot all the way through to FB - a man can dream. I'll update more when I know for sure. I also found that most good web sources these days have a direct 'post to facebook' option, which renders the whole 'share through google reader' functionality less necessary.</p>
<p>Finally, the kicker is that I can post a status update via ping.fm, and that seems to be able to shoot through to - linkedin, facebook, friendfeed, and Twitter.</p>
<p>Friendfeed I only use to bounce stuff into my Vox account via RSS, but Vox won't let me automate it. I only signed up at Vox for an open_id, and it kind of sucks, but friendfeed is pretty good for aggregating last.fm info with fb status stuff, give you that voice of a proletariat. Sheesh. Lastly, my thesixtyone account seems to have some Twitter interfacing abilities, but I am so tired of u/p combos and dev keys that I am probably going to drink a whole bottle of whiskey before dinner.</p>
<p>So there you have it. </p>
<p>bottom line: Skip Vox, they are not very cool.</p>

        <title>Jeremy Scahill talk about Obama</title>
        <link>2009/03/jeremy-scahill-talk-about-obama</link>
        <description><p>You can look at the direction of US policy like this: We have a president now who said he'll use preemptive military action inside of the borders of another country without informing the leadership of that country, if he deems it's in the interests of the US, as in the case of Pakistan; a president who's just delivered what, for all practical purposes, sounded like the victory speech of the previous president for his war based on lies and illegal acts of aggression, and who is surging, beyond the wildest hopes of the Republicans, in Afghanistan, putting more troops than almost any other politician was calling for, and is going to get the US further just sunk into the hole of a very violent and bloody war of occupation in Afghanistan.</p>


<p>This is, once again, an imperial presidency, and I think it's cause for great, great concern. And unfortunately, the spines of many people that actually have the ear of Obama seem to have been surgically removed now that he is president.</p>

        <title>git ftw</title>
        <link>2009/02/git-ftw</link>
        <description><p>copied from:<br />
            <a href="http://www.simplisticcomplexity.com/2008/03/05/cleanly-migrate-your-subversion-repository-to-a-git-repository/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Cleanly Migrate Your Subversion Repository To a GIT Repository">Cleanly Migrate Your Subversion Repository To a GIT Repository</a></p>


<p>The first thing we need to do is create a <em>users</em> file that maps all your SVN users to your GIT users. Just make a file on your Desktop named &#039;users.txt&#039;. Map the users using this format:</p>


<p>jmaddox = Jon Maddox<br />
bigpappa = Brian Biggs </p>


<p>Simple. Now here are the commands you&#039;ll run. I&#039;ll explain them below.</p>


<p>mkdir my_blog_tmp<br />
cd my_blog_tmp<br />
git-svn init <a href="http://code.yoursite.net/my_blog/trunk/">http://code.yoursite.net/my_blog/trunk/</a> --no-metadata<br />
git config svn.authorsfile ~/Desktop/users.txt<br />
git-svn fetch</p>


<p>The first two are self explanatory, we&#039;re making a new directory for the temporary repository. The second command initializes the directory as a git-svn hybrid thing and points the origin at your SVN repository. The flag, --no-metadata, tells GIT to leave all the SVN details behind (not the commit log). The fourth command tells GIT to remap all the SVN users to GIT users when it sucks down the source and history. The last command actually does the fetching.</p>


<p>Ok, so now after a few LONG minutes, your source is all there. Do a git log to see that your users have been mapped. Sweet!</p>


<p>Now you just have one last step. You need to clone this repository. Why do we do this? When doing a normal git clone it will take everything we want from the temporary repository, while leaving behind all the SVN cruft that was there to support the git-svn stuff.</p>


<p>git clone my_blog_tmp my_blog</p>

        <title>Oh really? Goldman Sachs is spending our taxes on executive bonuses.</title>
        <link>2009/02/oh-really-goldman-sachs-is-spending-our-taxes-on-executive-bonuses</link>
        <description><p>Goldman spokesman Michael DuVally says no tarp money is going to bonuses: "The compensation that was paid to employees came out of our business activities.” Charles Geisst, finance professor at Manhattan College and author of the upcoming Collateral Damaged: The Marketing of Consumer Debt to America, begs to differ. "If they didn't have the tarp money, they would be forced to raise fresh capital,” he says. "Now, I agree it's a long-term item on the balance sheet. But [without the government money] they would have to take a dip into what operating profits they have left, and reduce those salaries. So the tarp money is a substitute. Theirs is an extremely disingenuous argument.” Counters DuVally, "Professor Geisst is wrong. We paid bonuses out of earnings, not capital.” But as former compensation consultant Graef Crystal put it on Bloomberg.com, "The argument of saying we're not using the bailout money is just crap because money's fungible. Money's money. It exposes them to ridicule.”</p>

<p>I needed to rip an old live dvd from about 5 years ago with an archaic encryption and this little puppy did it - on my Intel MacBook Pro. I also had to buy the <a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/mpeg2/">http://www.apple.com/quicktime/mpeg2/</a> Quicktime encoder. Leave it to QT to fleece you every change they get. The streamclip utility works really well and will allow to you crop video - something QT would be happy to charge you another $30 for (Quicktime &#039;Pro&#039;). Don&#039;t do it. You need the mpeg2 encoder but don&#039;t buy the Quicktime Pro - it is more or less worthless.</p>

        <title>Mac vs PC oy the controversy</title>
        <link>2009/02/mac-vs-pc-oy-the-controversy</link>
        <description><p>I stumbled across this ( <a href="http://tech.yahoo.com/blogs/null/116923">http://tech.yahoo.com/blogs/null/116923</a> ) story today, and as is increasingly the case, the comments are far more interesting than the article. It seems that people have very strong opinions about Microsoft and Vista. The general consensus - most people HATE Vista. I am one of those people, not so much because I know too much about it - other than it is a resource hog, is very slow, and was basically conceived of in order to sell more &#039;stuff&#039; - as opposed to meeting any sort of concrete need.</p>


<p>Anyway, here it is in a nutshell - if you want user-friendly, totally reliable, works right out of the box, get a Mac. I couldn&#039;t possibly use anything other than my MacBook Pro for the software development I do. Linux is a relatively close second. Windows is way behind the pack.</p>


<p>So that&#039;s my two cents - Microsoft? Mostly just a piece of sh1t.</p>


<p>I always tell this story at work - basically a few years back I wrote reports for Fox IT and I had to install the whole .NET stack - information server (IS), the .NET platform, and then Reporting Services platform (a branch of Visual Studio). It literally took me a week. After about 6 attempted installs that went wrong for one reason or another - adding patches in wrong order, finding the right MS subscription disc for the newest RS install, wrestling the right admin privileges from the network admins, etc. A whole week.</p>


<p>You can walk into an Apple store, buy a MacBook off the shelf, download the latest Ruby/Rails stack and be up and running by maybe right after lunch time. There is just no comparison. Of course you have to write your own reports (as there is no real reporting platform yet for Rails) but there WILL be, and for now writing reports with rails is already pretty easy.</p>

<p>End of June actually.</p>


<p>So of course, I have a wedding album to make which will contain some new songs and some unreleased old songs. I don't have a name for it yet, but it is going to be awesome.</p>


<p>To go along with that, I have a show coming up in April again at the Santa Monica Farmer's market and then that will probably be it for a while. 5 albums in 6 years means I get to take a break. :)</p>




<p>And I could use some more comments in the Apple Store, so thanks for your support!</p>

Keep Me Here<br />
Mona Lisa<br />
Sunshine<br />

        <title>MySQL 5.0 SP with Cursor Logic</title>
        <link>2009/01/mysql-5-0-sp-with-cursor-logic</link>
        <description><p>I have written a bunch of SPs over the years (stored procedure, as I learned it, but MySQL calls them Stored Routines - SRs?). I even have my best/largest/most complicated SP ever linked here at <a href='http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/migration189.txt'>migration189</a>.
</p>


<p>That one was of course written in PL/SQL, and I have now officially moved out of the world of Oracle and into the world of MySQL 5.0 - which is sort of like moving from New York City to San Jose (weather notwithstanding).</p>


<p>Anyway, I found precious little RECENT coverage on how MySQL implemented it&#039;s &#039;stored routines&#039;, and I got to tell ya it took some digging - never mind trying to figure out how cursors work. MySQL, btw, has an ok documentation section but it is mediocre at best, somehow following in the fragmented example of the Rails community in what seems to be the curse of the open-source ADD.</p>


<p>So in the spirit of this site which has always been to keep pieces of code lying around that I may use later - here is my very first MySQL sp, which does nothing really useful except use a cursor to insert values into a table. Come back next week for the syntax needed to use parameters, lol.</p>


<p>Other things to notice - you have to declare a separate handler for pulling out of a cursor loop when you run out of records (does anyone else remember fondly how easy ADO recordsets were to use?) but other than that things look all right in MySQL land. Bye Oracle!</p>




<script src="https://gist.github.com/860870.js?file=cursor_sample.sql"></script>




<p>ps, gotta give a shout out to <a href="http://www.razorsql.com/">http://www.razorsql.com/</a> which so far has been easy to use and has served as stand-in IDE for Toad, which is what I was used to.</p>


<p>UPDATE: I now use SEQUEL PRO. (MAR 2011)</p>

        <title>Perl linux and database backups</title>
        <link>2009/01/perl-linux-and-database-backups</link>
        <description><p>I got to tell ya, most of the greatest people don&#039;t get the recognition they deserve. Open Source is all about everyone putting in what they got. So mosey on over to <a href="http://worldcommunity.com/opensource/">http://worldcommunity.com/opensource/</a> and tell Peter Brown that his Perl-based mysql backup script works like a charm.</p>


<p>It is very easy to set up, so I won&#039;t go too far into it - just download and follow the instructions. I also opted in to for the ftp push, so after the script dumps out a mysql txt file for every table, it will tar it, zip it, and push it to the ftp server of your choice. Cool.</p>


<p>This is where it gets tricky - I pulled this little gem out of a comment on Peter Brown&#039;s site. This script leaves you with a directory of txt files - most of us are used to the single .sql file of the whole db, so getting at a full restore from a bunch of txt files does not sound fun - until linux jumps in for the rescue.</p>


<p>Get this, just untar it:</p>


<p>  tar -xf bak.mysql.2009-01-20_14.55.30_.tar.gz</p>


<p>Move into that directory:</p>


<p>  cd bak.mysql.2009-01-20_14.55.30</p>


<p>and hit it with the cat xargs combo, shooting it right into mysql:</p>


<p>  find . -name "*.txt" -print | xargs -t --replace cat {} | mysql your_db_name -u your_db_user -p -h subdir.yoursite.com</p>


<p>and you&#039;re done! sweet, huh?</p>


<p>p.s. - the -h switch at the end (-h subdir.yoursite.com) is not always necessary, if it is localhost you can leave it out.<a href="http://www.digbox.net/index.php/dba/mysql/perl-linux-and-database-backups">Original post</a> blogged on <a href="http://codeboxer.com">codeboxer.com</a>.</p>

        <title>This Land is Your Land by Woody Guthrie</title>
        <link>2009/01/this-land-is-your-land-by-woody-guthrie</link>
        <description><p>This land is your land, this land is my land<br />
From California, to the New York Island<br />
From the redwood forest, to the gulf stream waters<br />
This land was made for you and me</p>


<p>As I was walking a ribbon of highway<br />
I saw above me an endless skyway<br />
I saw below me a golden valley<br />
This land was made for you and me</p>


<p>Chorus</p>


<p>I've roamed and rambled and I've followed my footsteps<br />
To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts<br />
And all around me a voice was sounding<br />
This land was made for you and me</p>


<p>Chorus</p>


<p>The sun comes shining as I was strolling<br />
The wheat fields waving and the dust clouds rolling<br />
The fog was lifting a voice come chanting<br />
This land was made for you and me</p>


<p>Chorus</p>


<p>There was a big high wall there that tried to stop me;<br />
Sign was painted, it said private property;<br />
But on the back side it didn't say nothing;<br />
That side was made for you and me.</p>


<p>Chorus</p>


<p>In the shadow of the steeple I saw my people,<br />
By the relief office I seen my people;<br />
As they stood there hungry, I stood there whistling<br />
Is this land made for you and me?</p>


<p>Chorus</p>


<p>Nobody living can ever stop me,<br />
As I go walking that freedom highway;<br />
Nobody living can ever make me turn back<br />
This land was made for you and me.</p>

        <title>right joins versus the subquery</title>
        <link>2009/01/right-joins-versus-the-subquery</link>
        <description><p>If you&#039;re anything like me, you are a serious pragmatist. I like to get at the problem immediately, and if there are shortcuts, then we have to weight short-term versus long-term gain before we can choose sides.</p>


<p>Here is a great SQL example of this principle.</p>


<p>The old-school way to write this query would be with the subquery, like so:</p>




<script src="https://gist.github.com/860884.js?file=right_join_sample1.sql"></script>




<p>I am simply trying to verify that I have not seen sales for the &#039;Ralphs&#039; retailer come in yet, despite that &#039;merchant&#039; value already being present in the retailers table.</p>


<p>I know, it&#039;s a little confusing, but bear with me.</p>


<p>One might also write:</p>




<script src="https://gist.github.com/860890.js?file=right_join_sample2.sql"></script>




<p>Neither of these run very well. Without some added indexing, the first query won&#039;t return anything at all before it times out, and the second one runs ok but it is about 3 to 4 times slower than the right join (below).</p>




<script src="https://gist.github.com/860896.js?file=right_join_sample3.sql"></script>




<p>There you have it - right joins FTW.</p>

        <title>Who started it? Israel...</title>
        <link>2009/01/who-started-it-israel</link>
        <description><p>On November 4th, here [the] record is clear: Israel broke the ceasefire by going into Gaza and killing six or seven Palestinian militants. At that point—and now I'm quoting the official Israeli website—Hamas retaliated or, in retaliation for the Israeli attack, then launched the missiles. -Norman Finkelstein, quoted JAN 8, 2009 on <a href="http://democracynow.org" title="http://democracynow.org">http://democracynow.org</a>.</p>


<p><a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2009/1/8/former_amb_martin_indyk_vs_author" title="http://www.democracynow.org/2009/1/8/former_amb_martin_indyk_vs_author">http://www.democracynow.org/2009/1/8/former_amb_martin_indyk_vs_author</a></p>


<p><a href="http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/" title="http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/">http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/</a></p>


<p>continued:</p>


<p>Now, as to the reason why, the record is fairly clear as well. According to Ha'aretz, Defense Minister Barak began plans for this invasion before the ceasefire even began. In fact, according to yesterday's Ha'aretz, the plans for the invasion began in March. And the main reasons for the invasion, I think, are twofold. Number one, as Mr. Indyk I think correctly points out, to enhance what Israel calls its deterrence capacity, which in layman's language basically means Israel's capacity to terrorize the region into submission. After their defeat in July 2006 in Lebanon, they felt it important to transmit the message that Israel is still a fighting force, still capable of terrorizing those who dare defy its word.</p>


<p>And the second main reason for the attack is because Hamas was signaling that it wanted a diplomatic settlement of the conflict along the June 1967 border. That is to say, Hamas was signaling they had joined the international consensus, they had joined most of the international community, overwhelmingly the international community, in seeking a diplomatic settlement. And at that point, Israel was faced with what Israelis call a Palestinian peace offensive. And in order to defeat the peace offensive, they sought to dismantle Hamas.</p>

        <title>scoping for dummies</title>
        <link>2009/01/scoping-for-dummies</link>
        <description><p>I hope I don&#039;t have to explain what scoping is. It is sort of analogous to the &#039;parameterized&#039; in &#039;parameterized query&#039;. Basically, once you start getting all hot and heavy with active record, you don&#039;t want to have write a specific model based routine to match EVERY query use-case, so enter scoping.</p>


<p>Here is an example:</p>

        <title>Bushisms</title>
        <link>2009/01/bushisms</link>
        <description><p>President George W. Bush will leave behind a legacy of Bushisms, the label stamped on the commander in chief's original speaking style. Some of the president's more notable malaprops and mangled statements:</p>


<p>___</p>


<p>• "I know the human being and fish can coexist peacefully." — September 2000, explaining his energy policies at an event in Michigan.</p>


<p>• "Rarely is the question asked, is our children learning?" — January 2000, during a campaign event in South Carolina.</p>


<p>• "They misunderestimated the compassion of our country. I think they misunderestimated the will and determination of the commander in chief, too." — Sept. 26, 2001, in Langley, Va. Bush was referring to the terrorists who carried out the Sept. 11 attacks.</p>


<p>• "There's no doubt in my mind, not one doubt in my mind, that we will fail." — Oct. 4, 2001, in Washington. Bush was remarking on a back-to-work plan after the terrorist attacks.</p>


<p>• "It would be a mistake for the United States Senate to allow any kind of human cloning to come out of that chamber." — April 10, 2002, at the White House, as Bush urged Senate passage of a broad ban on cloning.</p>


<p>• "I want to thank the dozens of welfare-to-work stories, the actual examples of people who made the firm and solemn commitment to work hard to embetter themselves." — April 18, 2002, at the White House.</p>


<p>• "There's an old saying in Tennessee — I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee — that says, fool me once, shame on — shame on you. Fool me — you can't get fooled again." — Sept. 17, 2002, in Nashville, Tenn.</p>


<p>• "Our enemies are innovative and resourceful, and so are we. They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people, and neither do we." — Aug. 5, 2004, at the signing ceremony for a defense spending bill.</p>


<p>• "Too many good docs are getting out of business. Too many OB/GYNs aren't able to practice their love with women all across this country." — Sept. 6, 2004, at a rally in Poplar Bluff, Mo.</p>


<p>• "Our most abundant energy source is coal. We have enough coal to last for 250 years, yet coal also prevents an environmental challenge." — April 20, 2005, in Washington.</p>


<p>• "We look forward to hearing your vision, so we can more better do our job." — Sept. 20, 2005, in Gulfport, Miss.</p>


<p>• "I can't wait to join you in the joy of welcoming neighbors back into neighborhoods, and small businesses up and running, and cutting those ribbons that somebody is creating new jobs." — Sept. 5, 2005, when Bush met with residents of Poplarville, Miss., in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.</p>


<p>• "It was not always a given that the United States and America would have a close relationship. After all, 60 years we were at war 60 years ago we were at war." — June 29, 2006, at the White House, where Bush met with Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi.</p>


<p>• "Make no mistake about it, I understand how tough it is, sir. I talk to families who die." — Dec. 7, 2006, in a joint appearance with British Prime Minister Tony Blair.</p>


<p>• "These are big achievements for this country, and the people of Bulgaria ought to be proud of the achievements that they have achieved." — June 11, 2007, in Sofia, Bulgaria.</p>


<p>• "Mr. Prime Minister, thank you for your introduction. Thank you for being such a fine host for the OPEC summit." — September 2007, in Sydney, Australia, where Bush was attending an APEC summit.</p>


<p>• "Thank you, Your Holiness. Awesome speech." April 16, 2008, at a ceremony welcoming Pope Benedict XVI to the White House.</p>


<p>• "The fact that they purchased the machine meant somebody had to make the machine. And when somebody makes a machine, it means there's jobs at the machine-making place." — May 27, 2008, in Mesa, Ariz.</p>


<p>• "And they have no disregard for human life." — July 15, 2008, at the White House. Bush was referring to enemy fighters in Afghanistan.</p>

<p>• "Throughout our history, the words of the Declaration have inspired immigrants from around the world to set sail to our shores. These immigrants have helped transform 13 small colonies into a great and growing nation of more than 300 people." — July 4, 2008 in Virginia.</p>


<p>• "The people in Louisiana must know that all across our country there's a lot of prayer — prayer for those whose lives have been turned upside down. And I'm one of them. It's good to come down here." — Sept. 3, 2008, at an emergency operations center in Baton Rouge, La., after Hurricane Gustav hit the Gulf Coast.</p>


<p>• "This thaw — took a while to thaw, it's going to take a while to unthaw." Oct. 20, 2008, in Alexandria, La., as he discussed the economy and frozen credit markets.</p>

        <title>Do the Alexa Dance aka a review of Alexa reviews</title>
        <link>2008/12/do-the-alexa-dance-aka-a-review-of-alexa-reviews</link>
        <description><p>I won&#039;t name names, or link links as it were, but ever since I discovered my own Alexa ranking(s) I have been obsessed with understanding how to optimize them - and as a matter of course I have read quite a few blogs about it. Without succumbing to the cliche of promising &#039;20 Ways to Game Your Ranking&#039;, I will share what I know.</p>


<p>The only people that matter are the users that have installed the Alexa toolbar from <a href="http://www.alexa.com/site/download">http://www.alexa.com/site/download</a>.</p>


<p>The traffic to your site of these users with the <a href="http://www.alexa.com/site/download">toolbar</a> installed over the last 3 months is what determines your rank. So at the most basic level, the logical thing to do is bump up marketing (really?) and hope that a good percentage of those new clicks are Alexa users. This may be effective, but it is also wasteful to some degree.</p>


<p>It is also worth noting that the Alexa user base reputedly skews very much towards webmasters, so another good way to attract a stronger percentage of Alexa users relative to your total user base is to target content towards webmasters, like a laser. You zap in their clicks with post titles like &#039;20 Sure Fire Tips on How to Be An Alexa Jedi&#039; or &#039;I Made It Into the Alexa Top 1000 - In Only 10 Minutes!&#039;. Of course you also need to have real stuff for them to read, or else the Jedi jokes can get your Force cut off. Anyway, my angle is that I work with Ruby on Rails, I post about Ruby On Rails, and I am a webmaster - so there&#039;s your targeted audience. </p>


<p>That being said, I have started a new category (<a href="http://www.digbox.net/index.php/alexa/" title="http://www.digbox.net/index.php/alexa/">http://www.digbox.net/index.php/alexa/</a>) to track my newfound obsession. And if you are reading this and haven&#039;t already installed your very own <a href="http://www.alexa.com/site/download">toolbar</a> then you don&#039;t deserve to be reading this, and I&#039;ll probably cry myself to sleep tonight. I hope you&#039;re happy.</p>


<p>Tune in next week for more observations.</p>

        <title>Tableless models and a checkbox collection</title>
        <link>2008/12/tableless-models-and-a-checkbox-collection</link>
        <description><p>I have always loved the sound of a table-less model. It feels so dirty. Here is one from the school of hard knocks, known as the Merchant model:</p>


<p>class Merchant &lt; ActiveRecord::Base<br />
  def self.columns() @columns ||= []; end</p>


<p>  def self.column(name, sql_type = nil, default = nil, null = true)<br />
    columns &lt;&lt; ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::Column.new(name.to_s, default, sql_type.to_s, null)<br />

<p>Of course, it does hit the database, but there is no Merchants table, per se, there is just this model. What returns from a &#039;SELECT * FROM MERCHANTS&#039; is the distinct selection for the value of &#039;merchant&#039; from the Retailers table. These come in from the partners, and they are very consistent. I can&#039;t tell you how helpful this is. The system auto-magically created a Target.com that showed up immediately alongside it&#039;s older bother, Target. Watch out, however, for cache-ing concerns that will necessarily stem from this approach in terms of scale - in this case, that was not a concern because we have a very small (but highly lucrative) user base.</p>


<p>This is the corresponding controller code. This is from the pages_controller, because there is no direct merchants_controller.</p>


<p>       def update<br />
        @page = Page.find(params[:id])</p>


<p>         if @page.update_attributes(params[:page])<br />
          if dump_all_merchant_pages(@page.id)<br />
            params[:merchants].each do |p|<br />
              create_or_update_merchant_page(p[0].to_s, @page.id, true)<br />
            end<br />
          end<br />
          flash[:notice] = &#039;Page was successfully updated.&#039;<br />
          redirect_to pages_path<br />
        else<br />
          render :action =&gt; &#039;edit&#039;<br />
        end<br />
      end</p>


<p>the functions, from the bottom of the page:</p>


<p>     private<br />
      def dump_all_merchant_pages(page_id)<br />
        Page.find(page_id).merchant_pages.each do |x|<br />
          x.destroy<br />
        end<br />
        true<br />
      end</p>


<p>       def create_or_update_merchant_page(m, p, val)<br />
        x = MerchantPage.find_by_sql(["SELECT merchant<br />

        <title>polymorphic user list class</title>
        <link>2008/12/polymorphic-user-list-class</link>
        <description><p>I wrote this for a job interview that never panned out. Tune in next week for the matching User class (linked <a href="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/2008/12/polymorphic-user-list-class-part-ii/">here</a>).<br />
Question: why do interviewers often admit to not being very technical, yet continue on to ask complicated questions and become bewildered as a consequence? </p>


<p>And furthermore, how good is the guy they hire if no one knows how to talk to him? Ah well, it is almost Christmas.</p>

        <title>JOYENT IS THE WORST</title>
        <link>2008/12/joyent-is-the-worst</link>
        <description><p>CONTRARY TO ANYTHING I HAVE SAID PREVIOUSLY, Joyent offers some of the worst customer service around. JOYENT has no idea what is going on. They don&#039;t even read the support tickets, their documentation is old and useless. They are a dinosaur.<br />
I imagine their clients are all catching on right now and starting to jump off of that sinking ship. I pulled my last account off of this horrible Rails hosting service this year, I will NEVER go back.</p>


<p>I hate bad service. Bad value, too.</p>

        <title>DREAMHOST Worst host evar</title>
        <link>2008/12/dreamhost-worst-host-evar</link>
        <description><p>Dreamhost is also pretty crappy, if you need Ruby on Rails support. Why does everyone advertise RoR and then not support it?</p>


<p>It looks like a decent Hostmonster style host, with a snazzy interface, but at the end of it here were the problems:</p>


<p>Terrible SVN support; let me say that again - SVN kind of sucks already, but I ended up with a bunch of 500 errors, and I don&#039;t need anyone to help SVN suck more than it already does.</p>


<p>SOME good wiki stuff, but it was out of date, was NOT supported (see above), so I got frustratingly 80% close to a real capistrano deploy and then could not finish because were server compatibility issues (an old Ruby version) and without direct shell access I was fecocked. Then my SVN got corrupted. Fun!</p>


<p>With Dreamhost, if you aren&#039;t paying for a hosting service, you can&#039;t even manage your domain forwarding.</p>


<p>So I am still on the lookout for a good Ruby host and I am not any closer.</p>


<p>As a recap - DREAMHOST is the worst Ruby on Rails hosting service EVER! They are, of course, right there next to Joyent, who also has a large home in Crapistan.</p>

        <title>can you believe this?</title>
        <link>2008/12/can-you-believe-this</link>
        <description><p>A Wal-Mart worker died early Friday after an "out-of-control" mob of frenzied shoppers smashed through the Long Island store's front doors and trampled him, police said.</p>


<p>The Black Friday stampede plunged the Valley Stream outlet into chaos, knocking several employees to the ground and sending others scurrying atop vending machines to avoid the horde.</p>


<p>When the madness ended, 34-year-old Jdimytai Damour was dead and four shoppers, including a woman eight months pregnant, were injured.<br />
CAUGHT ON CAMERA: WAL-MART CROWD MOMENTS BEFORE DEADLY STAMPEDE</p>


<p>"He was bum-rushed by 200 people," said Wal-Mart worker Jimmy Overby, 43.</p>


<p>"They took the doors off the hinges. He was trampled and killed in front of me.</p>


<p>"They took me down, too ... I didn't know if I was going to live through it. I literally had to fight people off my back," Overby said.</p>


<p>Damour, a temporary maintenance worker from Jamaica, Queens, was gasping for air as shoppers continued to surge into the store after its 5 a.m. opening, witnesses said.</p>


<p>Even officers who arrived to perform CPR on the trampled worker were stepped on by wild-eyed shoppers streaming inside, a cop at the scene said.</p>


<p>"They pushed him down and walked all over him," Damour's sobbing sister, Danielle, 41, said. "How could these people do that?</p>


<p>"He was such a young man with a good heart, full of life. He didn't deserve that."</p>


<p>Damour's sister said doctors told the family he died of a heart attack.</p>


<p>His cousin, Ernst Damour, called the circumstances "completely unacceptable."</p>


<p>"His body was a stepping bag with so much disregard for human life," Ernst Damour, 37, said. "There has to be some accountability."</p>


<p>Roughly 2,000 people gathered outside the Wal-Mart's doors in the predawn darkness.</p>


<p>Chanting "push the doors in," the crowd pressed against the glass as the clock ticked down to the 5 a.m. opening.</p>


<p>Sensing catastrophe, nervous employees formed a human chain inside the entrance to slow down the mass of shoppers.</p>


<p>It didn't work.</p>


<p>The mob barreled in and overwhelmed workers.</p>


<p>"They were jumping over the barricades and breaking down the door," said Pat Alexander, 53, of Crown Heights, Brooklyn. "Everyone was screaming. You just had to keep walking on your toes to keep from falling over."</p>


<p>After the throng toppled Damour, his fellow employees had to fight through the crowd to help him, police said.</p>


<p>Witness Kimberly Cribbs said shoppers acted like "savages."</p>


<p>"When they were saying they had to leave, that an employee got killed, people were yelling, 'I've been on line since Friday morning!'" Cribbs said. "They kept shopping." </p>


<p>When paramedics arrived, Damour's condition was grave.</p>


<p>"They were pumping his chest, trying to bring him back, and there was nothing," said Dennis Smokes, 36, a Wal-Mart worker.</p>


<p>Damour was taken to Franklin Hospital and pronounced dead at 6:03 a.m.</p>


<p>Hank Mullany, president of Wal-Mart's northeast division, said the company took extraordinary safety precautions.</p>


<p>"We expected a large crowd this morning and added additional internal security, additional third-party security, additional store associates and we worked closely with the Nassau County police," he said in a statement.</p>


<p>"We also erected barricades. Despite all of our precautions, this unfortunate event occurred."</p>


<p>The 28-year-old pregnant woman and three other shoppers were taken to area hospitals with minor injuries, police said.</p>


<p>In a news conference after the incident, Nassau County police spokesman Lt. Michael Fleming described the crowd as "out of control" and the scene as "utter chaos." He said Wal-Mart did not have enough security onhand.</p>


<p>Fleming said criminal charges were possible but that it would be difficult to identify individual shoppers in surveillance videos.</p>


<p>Items on sale at the Wal-Mart store included a $798 Samsung 50-inch Plasma HDTV, a Bissel Compact Upright Vacuum for $28 and Men's Wrangler Tough Jeans for $8.</p>


<p>The Long Island store reopened at 1 p.m. and was packed within minutes.</p>


<p>"I look at these people's faces and I keep thinking one of them could have stepped on him," said one employee. "How could you take a man's life to save $20 on a TV?"</p>

        <title>asynchronous javascript FTW</title>
        <link>2008/11/asynchronous-javascript-ftw</link>
        <description><p>link_to_remote(name, options = {}, html_options = {})</p>


<p>Returns a link to a remote action defined by options[:url] (using the url_for format) that&#039;s called in the background using XMLHttpRequest. The result of that request can then be inserted into a DOM object whose id can be specified with options[:update]. Usually, the result would be a partial prepared by the controller with either render_partial or render_partial_collection.</p>


<p>Examples:</p>


<p>link_to_remote "Delete this post", :update =&gt; "posts", :url =&gt; { :action =&gt; "destroy", :id =&gt; post.id }<br />
link_to_remote(image_tag("refresh"), :update =&gt; "emails", :url =&gt; { :action =&gt; "list_emails" })<br />
You can also specify a hash for options[:update] to allow for easy redirection of output to an other DOM element if a server-side error occurs:</p>


<p>Example:</p>


<p>  link_to_remote "Delete this post",<br />
     :url =&gt; { :action =&gt; "destroy", :id =&gt; post.id },<br />
     :update =&gt; { :success =&gt; "posts", :failure =&gt; "error" }</p>


<p>Optionally, you can use the options[: position] parameter to influence how the target DOM element is updated. It must be one of :before, :top, :bottom, or :after.</p>


<p>By default, these remote requests are processed asynchronously during which various JavaScript callbacks can be triggered (for progress indicators and the likes). All callbacks get access to the request object, which holds the underlying XMLHttpRequest.</p>


<p>To access the server response, use request.responseText, to find out the HTTP status, use request.status.</p>


<p>Example:<br />
  link_to_remote word,<br />
      :url =&gt; { :action =&gt; "undo", :n =&gt; word_counter },<br />
      :complete =&gt; "undoRequestCompleted(request)"</p>


<p>The callbacks that may be specified are (in order):<br />
:loading:   Called when the remote document is being loaded with data by the browser.<br />
:loaded:    Called when the browser has finished loading the remote document.<br />
:interactive:   Called when the user can interact with the remote document, even though it has not finished loading.<br />
:success:   Called when the XMLHttpRequest is completed, and the HTTP status code is in the 2XX range.<br />
:failure:   Called when the XMLHttpRequest is completed, and the HTTP status code is not in the 2XX range.<br />
:complete:  Called when the XMLHttpRequest is complete (fires after success/failure if they are present).</p>


<p>You can further refine :success and :failure by adding additional callbacks for specific status codes:</p>


<p>Example:</p>


<p>  link_to_remote word,<br />
      :url =&gt; { :action =&gt; "action" },<br />
      404 =&gt; "alert(&#039;Not found...? Wrong URL...?&#039;)",<br />
      :failure =&gt; "alert(&#039;HTTP Error &#039; + request.status + &#039;!&#039;)"</p>


<p>A status code callback overrides the success/failure handlers if present.</p>

        <title>Lighthouse API integration in 10 minutes or less</title>
        <link>2008/11/lighthouse-api-integration-in-10-minutes-or-less</link>
        <description><p>As a second part in this series, I am going to talk about Lighthouse for a second. They rock. I built up a calendar app based on their API and the Ruby  <a href="http://digbox.net/index.php/2008/11/15/ruby_calendar_helper_for_dummies">calendar_helper</a>, and it barely took me a day. True story. I ended up using an API token, and I learned a lot about a lib/ based connection object, very interesting.</p>


<p>Here are a few caveats:<br />
Don&#039;t mess with the root class too much. It was not really necessary for most of what I had to do. This is actually one of the cases where it makes sense to load the logic into the controller (a little bit). Plus there isn&#039;t much more meat on the bone, so to speak, the root class covers 100% of a ludicrously simple back-end.<br />
All Lighthouse database objects are not created equal. Tickets are king, and everything else is nothing. I will explain more later - just don&#039;t try to get picky with your call for Milestones. All I have ever been able to do is return a simple dump.</p>


<p>Installation: all I had to do was click through to the <a href="http://github.com/Caged/lighthouse-api/tree/master">GIT repository</a>. From there click lib/, and then lighthouse.rb. Cut and paste the code you see into a lighthouse.rb file in your lib/ folder. Everything you need is right there.</p>


<p>code snippet from my controller action:</p>


<p>    if @project<br />
      #calculate i differential<br />
      month_now = Time.now.month<br />
      year_now = Time.now.year<br />
      i = ((@year - year_now)*12)+ (@month - month_now).abs<br />
      if i == 1<br />
        @tickets = @project.tickets(:q =&gt; "created:&#039;before #{Time.now.day} day#{Time.now.day&gt;1 ? &#039;s&#039; : &#039;&#039;} ago&#039;")<br />
      elsif i &gt; 1<br />
        @tickets = @project.tickets(:q =&gt; "created:&#039;before #{i-1} months ago&#039;")<br />
      else<br />
        @tickets = @project.tickets(:q =&gt; "created:&#039;since 1 month ago&#039;")<br />
      end<br />
      @milestones = @project.milestones(:q =&gt; "due_on:&#039;#{@month}/#{@year}&#039;")<br />
    else<br />
      false<br />
    end</p>


<p>Thankfully, you can get picky with your call for Tickets. That is where the meat of the API is. The text based date searching is pretty cool, because you get a hard limit of 30 rows returned from your query, so you need to be granular enough to catch only what you want.</p>


<p>This is a remote controller action that I use to get info about a particular ticket:</p>


<p>  def ticket_body<br />
    ticket_id = params[:id]<br />
    @project = Lighthouse::Project.find(:first)<br />
    ticket = Lighthouse::Ticket.find ticket_id, :params =&gt; {:project_id =&gt; @project.id}<br />
    out_string = ""<br />
    #counter = 0<br />
    ticket.versions.each do |version|<br />
      this_body = version.body_html<br />
      out_string &lt;&lt; "on #{(version.created_at - (60 * 60 * 8)).strftime("%m/%d at %I:%M%p")} #{get_owner_name(version.user_id)} said: #{this_body ? this_body : "status change"}"<br />
    end<br />
    render :text =&gt; out_string<br />
  end</p>


<p>Notice the 8 hour time differential from UTC code, and that you have to iterate through the ticket.versions to pull out the notes (thanks to Lighthouse help staff for that one).</p>


<p>And then, of course, I have this at the top of my controller:</p>


<p>  def initialize<br />
    Lighthouse.account = &#039;xxx&#039;<br />
    Lighthouse.token = &#039;1111919192384584XXXXXXXXXXX&#039;<br />
    @project = Lighthouse::Project.find(:first)<br />
  end</p>


<p>like I said before, somehow the @project.milestones method won&#039;t take a :q argument, so you&#039;re stuck with just a simple &#039;select *&#039; query for your @milestones recordset. Maybe they will change this soon.</p>

        <title>Rahm Emanuel - Zionist Warmonger?</title>
        <link>2008/11/rahm-emanuel-zionist-warmonger</link>
        <description><p>In his own words:</p>


<p>We should reform and strengthen multilateral institutions ... by 100,000 more troops. We must protect our homeland and civil liberties by creating a new domestic counterterrorism force like Britain's MI5.</p>


<p>full story:</p>


<p>What are Emanuel's views on war and peace? Emanuel has just supplied the answer in the form of a scrawny book co-authored with Bruce Reed, modestly entitled: The Plan: Big Ideas for America. The authors obligingly boil each of the eight parts of "The Plan" down to a single paragraph. The section which embraces all of foreign policy is entitled "A New Strategy to End the War on Terror," a heading revealing in itself since "war on terror" is the way the neocons and the Israeli Lobby currently like to frame the discussion of foreign policy. Here is the book's summary paragraph with my comments in parentheses:</p>


<p>"A New Strategy to Win the War on Terror"<br />
("War on Terror," as George Soros points out, is a false metaphor used by those who would drag us into military adventures not in our interest or that of humanity.)</p>


<p>"We need to use all the roots of American power to make our country safe. (He begins by playing on fear.) America must lead the world's fight against the spread of evil and totalitarianism, but we must stop trying to win that battle on our own. (Messianic imperialism.) We should reform and strengthen multilateral institutions for the twenty-first century, not walk away from them. We need to fortify the military's "thin green line" around the world by adding to the U.S. Special Forces and the Marines, and by expanding the U.S. army by 100,000 more troops. (An even bigger military for the world's most powerful armed forces, a very militaristic view of the way to handle the conflicts among nations. What uses does Emanuel have in mind for those troops?) We should give our troops a new GI Bill to come home to. (More material incentives to induce the financially strapped to sign up as cannon fodder.) Finally we must protect our homeland and civil liberties by creating a new domestic counterterrorism force like Britain's MI5. (A new domestic spying operation is an obvious threat to our civil liberties; MI5 holds secret files on one in 160 adults in Britain along with files on 53,000 organizations.)</p>

        <link>2008/11/obama-has-already-alienated-the-palestinian-lobby</link>
        <description><p>By distancing himself from some old Clintonites like Robert Malley, and getting cozy with 'democratic neocons' like Rahm Emanuel, Dennis Ross and Martin Indyk, Obama has already made up his mind: no love for Palestine. If we don't start leaning on the Obama administration really hard, we will wake up next year with a foreign policy agenda that is even further right than Bill Clinton's was - i.e., no change at all.<br />

        <description><p>As a result, overall U.S. credit card debt grew by 435% from 2002 to year-end 2007, from $211 billion to approximately $915 billion...<br />
Essentially, on average, America is broke and its credit cards played a dominant role in getting there.</p>


<p><a href="http://smirkingchimp.com/thread/18309" target="_blank">read more<br />
</a></p>


<p>Making matters worse, or more widespread throughout the economy, just as with mortgage debt, credit card debt is put into pools that are then resold to investment houses, other banks and institutional investors. About 45 percent of the nation's $900-plus billion in credit card debt has been packaged into these pools, and so many companies, not just a few, are at risk of being forced out of business by credit card debt write-offs.</p>

        <description><p>In point of fact, the dirty little secret of the banking industry is that it has no intention of using the money to make new loans.</p>


<p>Indeed, Mr. Landler's story noted that Treasury would even funnel some of the bailout money to help banks buy other banks. And, in an almost unnoticed move, it recently put in place a new tax break, worth billions to the banking industry, that has only one purpose: to encourage bank mergers.</p>

<p>" I say this based on my experience as the former head of the TVA, which bought and burned more than 30 million tons of coal a year.

<p>Brigade homeland tours start Oct. 1</p>


<p>3rd Infantry's 1st BCT trains for a new dwell-time mission. Helping ‘people at home' may become a permanent part of the active Army<br />
By Gina Cavallaro - Staff writer<br />

<p>The 3rd Infantry Division's 1st Brigade Combat Team has spent 35 of the last 60 months in Iraq patrolling in full battle rattle, helping restore essential services and escorting supply convoys.</p>


<p>Now they're training for the same mission — with a twist — at home.</p>


<p>Beginning Oct. 1 for 12 months, the 1st BCT will be under the day-to-day control of U.S. Army North, the Army service component of Northern Command, as an on-call federal response force for natural or manmade emergencies and disasters, including terrorist attacks.</p>


<p>It is not the first time an active-duty unit has been tapped to help at home. In August 2005, for example, when Hurricane Katrina unleashed hell in Mississippi and Louisiana, several active-duty units were pulled from various posts and mobilized to those areas.</p>


<p>But this new mission marks the first time an active unit has been given a dedicated assignment to NorthCom, a joint command established in 2002 to provide command and control for federal homeland defense efforts and coordinate defense support of civil authorities.</p>


<p>After 1st BCT finishes its dwell-time mission, expectations are that another, as yet unnamed, active-duty brigade will take over and that the mission will be a permanent one.</p>


<p>"Right now, the response force requirement will be an enduring mission. How the [Defense Department] chooses to source that and whether or not they continue to assign them to NorthCom, that could change in the future,” said Army Col. Louis Vogler, chief of NorthCom future operations. "Now, the plan is to assign a force every year.”</p>


<p>The command is at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado Springs, Colo., but the soldiers with 1st BCT, who returned in April after 15 months in Iraq, will operate out of their home post at Fort Stewart, Ga., where they'll be able to go to school, spend time with their families and train for their new homeland mission as well as the counterinsurgency mission in the war zones.</p>


<p>Stop-loss will not be in effect, so soldiers will be able to leave the Army or move to new assignments during the mission, and the operational tempo will be variable.</p>


<p>Don't look for any extra time off, though. The at-home mission does not take the place of scheduled combat-zone deployments and will take place during the so-called dwell time a unit gets to reset and regenerate after a deployment.</p>


<p>The 1st of the 3rd is still scheduled to deploy to either Iraq or Afghanistan in early 2010, which means the soldiers will have been home a minimum of 20 months by the time they ship out.</p>


<p>In the meantime, they'll learn new skills, use some of the ones they acquired in the war zone and more than likely will not be shot at while doing any of it.</p>


<p>They may be called upon to help with civil unrest and crowd control or to deal with potentially horrific scenarios such as massive poisoning and chaos in response to a chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear or high-yield explosive, or CBRNE, attack.</p>


<p>Training for homeland scenarios has already begun at Fort Stewart and includes specialty tasks such as knowing how to use the "jaws of life” to extract a person from a mangled vehicle; extra medical training for a CBRNE incident; and working with U.S. Forestry Service experts on how to go in with chainsaws and cut and clear trees to clear a road or area.</p>


<p>The 1st BCT's soldiers also will learn how to use "the first ever nonlethal package that the Army has fielded,” 1st BCT commander Col. Roger Cloutier said, referring to crowd and traffic control equipment and nonlethal weapons designed to subdue unruly or dangerous individuals without killing them.</p>


<p>The package is for use only in war-zone operations, not for any domestic purpose.</p>


<p>"It's a new modular package of nonlethal capabilities that they're fielding. They've been using pieces of it in Iraq, but this is the first time that these modules were consolidated and this package fielded, and because of this mission we're undertaking we were the first to get it.”</p>


<p>The package includes equipment to stand up a hasty road block; spike strips for slowing, stopping or controlling traffic; shields and batons; and, beanbag bullets.</p>


<p>"I was the first guy in the brigade to get Tasered,” said Cloutier, describing the experience as "your worst muscle cramp ever — times 10 throughout your whole body.</p>


<p>"I'm not a small guy, I weigh 230 pounds ... it put me on my knees in seconds.”</p>


<p>The brigade will not change its name, but the force will be known for the next year as a CBRNE Consequence Management Response Force, or CCMRF (pronounced "sea-smurf”).</p>


<p>"I can't think of a more noble mission than this,” said Cloutier, who took command in July. "We've been all over the world during this time of conflict, but now our mission is to take care of citizens at home ... and depending on where an event occurred, you're going home to take care of your home town, your loved ones.”</p>


<p>While soldiers' combat training is applicable, he said, some nuances don't apply.</p>


<p>"If we go in, we're going in to help American citizens on American soil, to save lives, provide critical life support, help clear debris, restore normalcy and support whatever local agencies need us to do, so it's kind of a different role,” said Cloutier, who, as the division operations officer on the last rotation, learned of the homeland mission a few months ago while they were still in Iraq.</p>


<p>Some brigade elements will be on call around the clock, during which time they'll do their regular marksmanship, gunnery and other deployment training. That's because the unit will continue to train and reset for the next deployment, even as it serves in its CCMRF mission.</p>


<p>Should personnel be needed at an earthquake in California, for example, all or part of the brigade could be scrambled there, depending on the extent of the need and the specialties involved.<br />
Other branches included</p>


<p>The active Army's new dwell-time mission is part of a NorthCom and DOD response package.</p>


<p>Active-duty soldiers will be part of a force that includes elements from other military branches and dedicated National Guard Weapons of Mass Destruction-Civil Support Teams.</p>


<p>A final mission rehearsal exercise is scheduled for mid-September at Fort Stewart and will be run by Joint Task Force Civil Support, a unit based out of Fort Monroe, Va., that will coordinate and evaluate the interservice event.</p>


<p>In addition to 1st BCT, other Army units will take part in the two-week training exercise, including elements of the 1st Medical Brigade out of Fort Hood, Texas, and the 82nd Combat Aviation Brigade from Fort Bragg, N.C.</p>


<p>There also will be Air Force engineer and medical units, the Marine Corps Chemical, Biological Initial Reaction Force, a Navy weather team and members of the Defense Logistics Agency and the Defense Threat Reduction Agency.</p>


<p>One of the things Vogler said they'll be looking at is communications capabilities between the services.</p>


<p>"It is a concern, and we're trying to check that and one of the ways we do that is by having these sorts of exercises. Leading up to this, we are going to rehearse and set up some of the communications systems to make sure we have interoperability,” he said.</p>


<p>"I don't know what America's overall plan is — I just know that 24 hours a day, seven days a week, there are soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines that are standing by to come and help if they're called,” Cloutier said. "It makes me feel good as an American to know that my country has dedicated a force to come in and help the people at home.”</p>


<p>———<br />
Correction:</p>


<p>A non-lethal crowd control package fielded to 1st Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division, described in the original version of this story, is intended for use on deployments to the war zone, not in the U.S., as previously stated</p>

The decision to salvage this insurance company (a decision that should have been taken by State insurance commissioners, not the FED) lies in the fact that it would have dragged down key banks like Goldman Sachs. This explains why Goldman's CEO Lloyd C. Blankfein, was the only Wall Street banker invited to participate in the last minute bail-out talks by FED governor Bernard B. Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson. Notably, before becoming George W Bush's Treasury Secretary in June 2006, Paulson was CEO of Goldman Sachs, at which time he was replaced by Blankfein.</p>


<p>19 September 2008: Henry Paulson, Bernard Shalom Bernanke and Christopher Cox (chairman of the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission - SEC) submitted to Congress an urgent 3-page Bail-out Plan (similar in style to Argentina's "financial armouring" of December 2000 which paved the way for 2001's total financial meltdown), to the tune of $ 700 billion which is supposed to stop further banking and financial failures in the US and worldwide. The urgency of the matter could be read in their panicky faces and the bill crashed in the House of Representative which rejected it on 22-Sept-08. It has since then grown to a 450-page dossier, now approved by the Senate and being resubmitted to the House.</p>


<p>Paulson and Bernanke seek "superpowers" from Congress, similar to the ones that former economy minister Domingo Cavallo wrenched from Argentina's Congress in 2001, which led to total collapse. In various declarations, president George W Bush stressed time and again the dire situation of this "national emergency". When asked how the amount of $ 700 billion was arrived at, Bernanke replied that it represents 5% (!!!) of mortgages that have become non-performing. Independent analysts, however, reckon that this 5% is insufficient to cover all bail-outs and that we need to look at 10, 15 or 20 percent of non-performing mortgages, which would turn bail-out figures into unfathomable amounts. Rejection of the bail-out plan on "Bloody Monday" led to a collapse of the Dow Jones Industrial Index by 778 points (more than 7%) and a 16% fall for financial institutions. Not surprisingly, in their 21st September edition the London newspaper "The Daily Telegraph" pointed out that we may be edging towards a US Government default on its entire $ 13.5 trillion debt.</p>


<p>The two remaining investment banks still considered to be "healthy" - i.e., prestigious Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley - decided to voluntarily become commercial banks, and thus accept greater regulatory scrutiny. Meanwhile and as a transitory emergency measure, financier Warren Buffet took a $ 5 billion stake in Goldman Sachs to help it become "more healthy", a clear indication of just how critical the situation is.</p>


<p>22 September 2008: After a strange period of silence regarding its situation as a major bank, CitiGroup finally appeared on the scene helping to engineer two bank bail-outs: Washington Mutual Savings &amp; Loan (the largest thrift in the US with assets for $ 309.7 billion), and Wachovia Bank (assets for $ 812.4 billion), although Wachovia is having second thoughts and may strike a deal with Wells Fargo.</p>


<p>September 22nd to 30th: The contagion crosses the Atlantic sending Europe into a crisis with a series of domino-like bank collapses:</p>


<p>Fortis (France-Belgium banking and insurance consortium with assets of $ 1.533 billion) is bailed out by the governments of Belgium, The Netherlands and Luxembourg Bradford &amp; Bigley, major UK Savings &amp; Loans association is rescued by the Spanish Santander Group at a cost of $ 30 billion, assets: $ 104 billion, Hypo Real Estate AG, a German bank bailed out by the government at a cost of $ 50 billion - with assets for $ 622.2 billion, Dexia - another Franco-Belgian bank rescued by their respective governments - Price tag: $ 9.2 billion - assets $ 913 billion, Glitnir (a major Icelandic bank nationalized 75% by the government at a cost of $ 900 billion; assets for $ 48.9 billion). Clearly, these amounts are truly staggering as in their aggregate they are greater than the United States' Gross Domestic Product, which gives a taste of things to come, considering that rumors of further banks failures on both sides of the Atlantic still continue: UniCredit, a pan-European bank based in Italy, which owns the German HypoVereinsbank and the Bank Austria.</p>


<p>UBS based in Zurich, Switzerland, and National City Corporation, Downey Financial Corporation and Sovereign Bancorp, of the United States - all these and more have high risk exposures to "toxic" mortgage securities, to use the charming term coined by Bernanke from the FED... Lastly, major press media and international analysts insist that the bill for these bail-outs will fall on "US Taxpayers" through future tax hikes. This is clearly only a half-truth. The full truth is that, as far as the US is concerned, the bulk of these bail-outs will be paid with even more uncontrolled monetary emission by the FED, which will further erode the value of the Dollar. In short, the cost for this disaster will be paid by companies, governments and individuals who have US-Dollar denominated assets throughout the world, and not just by the "American Taxpayers".<br /><a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article20939.htm">more info</a></p>

<p>In 1999 McCain attached a rider to the Defense Appropriations bill that would have permanently transferred to the Pentagon 7.2 million acres of federal wildlife refuge land managed by the BLM and the Fish and Wildlife Service, where they would become used as a bombing range and a testing ground for a new generation of missiles. McCain's rider exempted the military from conducting any environmental review of its programs.</p>

<p>Personally, I'm much more a fan of Kucinich's speech. A statement like that is really just ignorant. A half-term governor talks about 'clean coal' and being a 'hockey mom' and the right goes into seizures. Can no-one smell the shit anymore?<br />
<br /><br />
Here's a real speech - you know, one that talks about real issues + stuff:</p>

        <description><p>There is so much slang out there, I love it. I eat this stuff up. From the same demographic that brought you 'pwning', I give you:</p>


<p>RAWR - (to scream)</p>


<p>as in:</p>


<p><i>Nevertheless I will survive. And throwing lots of tantrums. And rawring. And ice creaming…</i></p>


<p><i>...perhaps you can specify which you meant before RAWRing at each other.</i></p>


<p><i>...metal and screaming/rawring plz can u give me sum pointers on how to do it better?</i></p>


<p><small>above quotes pulled randomly from google</small></p>


<p>Basically, it's sort of a respelling of 'Roaring' except it seems to have a bit of a 'griping' connotation. As in, screaming for the purposes of expressing dissatisfaction.</p>

        <title>Rails Playground a short review</title>
        <link>2008/07/rails-playground-a-short-review</link>
        <description><p>This will be quick. I just had to put in a few words about Rails Playground.</p>


<p>A little background: I have been hosting my sites with Joyent up until now, and this last week I was just having some serious mongrel problems, and it started not being fun. I started looking for alternatives, and I found Rails Playground (RP) and it has a pretty cool angle.</p>


<p>Joyent is ok, but their whole thing is that they are empowering you to do everything yourself. They are just giving you a sandbox, basically, which is great unless you start having problems that you don&#039;t know how to fix yourself. Then you have to wait for their relatively slow customer service.</p>


<p>RP, on the other hand, will give you unlimited, much faster service for comparable rates and they will set a lot of it up for you. I gave them my svn info, paid the bill, and they set me up with capistrano, added the capistano files to my svn account, set up the proxy, and configured mod_rails to run with passenger.<br />
Done!</p>


<p>I have never had a deployment go so easily.</p>


<p>Anyway that&#039;s my 2 cents.</p>


<p><a href="http://railsplayground.com">link to their site</a></p>


<p>Disclosure: I am not benefiting from this review at all. I asked them for a deal and they turned me down!</p>

<p>[Bush], who has been condemned throughout his presidency for failing to tackle climate change, ended a private meeting with the words: "Goodbye from the world's biggest polluter."</p>


<p>He then punched the air while grinning widely, as the rest of those present including Gordon Brown and Nicolas Sarkozy looked on in shock.</p>


<table style="width:auto;"><tr><td><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/NENbdSC82dhflmawK7mJeA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_aJ4urxfgN9A/TXXghgMAnOI/AAAAAAAAInA/TISdMmJAFBY/s288/Bush-G8-404b_686375c.jpg" height="168" width="288" /></a></td></tr><tr><td style="font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:11px; text-align:right">From <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/krister.axel/Stuff?feat=embedwebsite">stuff</a></td></tr></table>


<p>Mr Bush, whose second and final term as President ends at the end of the year, then left the meeting at the Windsor Hotel in Hokkaido where the leaders of the world's richest nations had been discussing new targets to cut carbon emissions.</p>


<p>One official who witnessed the extraordinary scene said afterwards: "Everyone was very surprised that he was making a joke about America's record on pollution."</p>


<p>Mr Bush also faced criticism at the summit after Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian Prime Minister, was described in the White House press pack given to journalists as one of the "most controversial leaders in the history of a country known for government corruption and vice".</p>


<p>The White House apologised for what it called "sloppy work" and said an official had simply lifted the characterisation from the internet without reading it.</p>


<p>Concluding the three-day event, leaders from the G8 and developing countries proclaimed a "shared vision" on climate change. However, they failed to bridge differences between rich and emerging nations on curbing emissions. </p>

        <description><p><i>To fund cumulative budget deficits, the government has borrowed a total of $5 trillion from the public as of the end of fiscal year 2007. The government has also borrowed excess annual cash flows from the Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds and similar funds to finance other government cost. Including interest, the government owes $4 trillion to these funds, which is backed by the full faith and credit of the government, resulting in total federal debt of $9 trillion.</i><br />

        <title>MySQL 5.0 Table Record Count By Month Pivot Query</title>
        <link>2008/05/mysql-5-0-table-record-count-by-month-pivot-query</link>
        <description><p>So there I was, hanging out at work on my birthday. I had a little time, so I decided to answer some Ruby forum questions (<a href="http://railsforum.com/" title="http://railsforum.com/">http://railsforum.com/</a>). I went through a few on them, and ended up writing a pivot query for someone, out of nostalgia for my last job where I did a lot more straight SQL programming - not like I miss it too much, but it felt good. Anyway, only once I was done did it occur to me that I could use this same query for a lot of things. It&#039;s a very multi-purpose pivot query - it pivots record counts on a single table by month, so one really fast query returns all of the record counts by month of whatever table you are curious about. The original guy on the forum needed it to turn menu buttons on and off according to whether there were records in the table for a given month (as in blog records).<br />
I recommend setting it up as a parameterized view with a single year parameter, because it won&#039;t distinguish by year otherwise. Map your parameter to where it says &#039;2008&#039; and you will be home free.</p>


<p>Instructions:<br />
1 - replace YOURTABLE with your table name.<br />
2 - replace all instances of &#039;created_at&#039; with a different (date) field name only if you want to use a different field to aggregate by. It will work fine as is with &#039;created_at&#039; because most Ruby tables have this field by default.<br />

        <description><p>A new record for sustained disappointment. According to ABC/WaPo polling, Bush is now the president with the longest period served without a majority of the public approving of the job he did. It has now been 39 months since Bush was last above 50% in approval, besting Harry Truman's old record of 38 months.<br />

        <title>Got gigs? How about some Farmers' cheese?</title>
        <link>2008/05/got-gigs-how-about-some-farmers-cheese</link>
        <description><p>These days, I do stealth gigs. You never see it coming, it feels more natural that way. You know, you just make some phone calls a few days out and cross your fingers.<br /><br />
After all these years, I just never really got the response from handing out flyers a few months in advance that I was looking for. It is a very Los Angeles thing to do, handing out little pocket flyers to everyone in the club on the weekends literally 8-10 weeks in advance of your show, the idea being that said flyer sort of ends up on a fridge or a coffee-table somewhere, sending out ripples of free viral advertising. I don't buy it. I think that rather, what happens is people resent the intrusion subconsciously, and have a number of weeks to feel increasingly guilty about the fact that they (somewhat irrationally) resent the idea of committing themselves to a course of action so far in advance. This mental process continues logically to the point where even if they are free, they don't want to go out as much because they at some point classified the event as a non-option. That's my 2 cents worth of amateur psychoanalysis.<br /><br />
So, if you are missing the Axel and want to hear some good music, please click below to view the details. There is no pre-committal. You can decide to go or not go on your own schedule. Because at the end of the day, I've got my own vehicle for free viral advertising - it's called a website.</p>

        <title>Unregulated capital and predatory lending</title>
        <link>2008/04/unregulated-capital-and-predatory-lending</link>
        <description><p>Oh yeah, and a war that costs a million dollars a minute. <br />
I was in San Francisco (S.F.) this weekend, and I happened to read an article in the S.F. Chronicle, which to my knowledge is a reputable new source. I am used to mainstream media butchering reality, but I guess this story riles me extra because Northern California is (purportedly) a haven of progressivism. Anyway, in a classic case of both irresponsible journalism and academic blowing smoke up your ass,  Sam Zuckerman really misses the point.</p>


<p>The link to the original article is below, but many of you won't read it so allow me to just quote the passages that are especially odious.</p>


<p><i>In effect, the United States has maxed out on its national credit card. Like it or not, that's one of the most important things now forcing a new standard of frugality on free-spending Americans.</i></p>


<p>Without mentioning the root causes for this phenomenon in terms of both political and fiscal accountability, Sam is either trying too hard to snare readers or worse, deliberately missing the point. The truth is that the only reason the credit spigot is drawing down is because the World Bank, the Fed, and the US government are being run by a bunch of elite-obsessed jackasses. It's not that I'm in favor of more US federal deficit spending but insinuating that somehow the US consumer 'had this coming' is a little like blaming the tree for totaling the car in a DWI. Paul Wolfowitz, Ben Bernanke and George Bush are <i>still</i> drunk behind the wheel. Alan Greenspan deserves his share of the blame as well.</p>


<p>another quote:<br />
<i>As difficult as the adjustment may be, experts say the change is important medicine. To take one example, we're moving into a period when loan standards are more realistic. Home buyers now have to put money down and pay interest appropriate for their level of creditworthiness.</i></p>


<p>It is positively ludicrous to suggest that it takes a complete meltdown of the domestic financial sector to impose common-sense regulations. Isn't that part of the mandate for the Federal Reserve in the first place, to ensure price stability? And who are these 'experts', anyway?</p>


<p>This is what Sam lists as his sources: Chronicle research, BudgetSavvyMag.com</p>


<p>Really? A staff writer for a respected newspaper in a progressive  and academic community quotes nothing reputable for a front page story in the Sunday edition? BudgetSavvyMag.com is hardly a source for anything but shopping tips, and 'Chronicle research' in essence means nothing at all coming from said journalist. If listing oneself as a source is now kosher then the logical end is one writer with multiple pseudonyms quoting himself religiously and to great effect within the letter of the law.</p>


<p>It pains me to know that most of the US will never really know where this credit storm came from. At the risk of oversimplifying, I will just put it this way:<br />
<b>Unregulated capital:</b> Since Reagan and his voodoo economics in the 1980s, the US financial sector has been systematically deregulated. One net effect of this change was that 'reserves' were no longer monitored in a meaningful way. Think of a blackjack addict who is forced to put 40-50% of his paycheck into a savings account every weekend BEFORE he goes to the casino. And then one day, that is a rule that he no longer has to follow (see <a href="http://www.wsws.org/articles/1999/nov1999/bank-n01.shtml" target="_blank">this article</a> for more info).</p>


<p><b>Predatory lending:</b> See above, once all of this newly unregulated cash was on the market, it had to be put somewhere. Enter 'sub-prime borrowers'. Overnight, the mortgage industry invented a new loan consumer class and started marketing mortgages very aggressively to anyone with a pulse. Most of these sub-prime borrowers had no idea what they were in for. Many of them did not even speak english. Greenspan and then Bernanke made it worse by (a) looking the other way for these shady loans and (b) feeding the credit bubble by keeping interest rates low.</p>


<p>Anyway, I have now concluded that 99% of mainstream media is pure doggerel. Sam leaves out enough important points to fill a grain silo. The blogs I read on SmirkingChimp.com are routinely more insightful and far more academically sound, both in terms of footnotes and logical argument. Let us all be thankful for the independent political blogging community sticking to the facts and using quotable sources, because writers like Sam Zuckerman are really stinking up the place.</p>

        <title>Heidi Montag has no brain</title>
        <link>2008/04/heidi-montag-has-no-brain</link>
        <description><p><i>Much of the rise in oil prices, of course, is only being felt by Americans, because it is an increase in the dollar price for oil. For Europeans and Asians, whose currencies are appreciating against the dollar, oil prices are not rising, and may even be falling.</i></p>




<p>There is something really wrong here. I have a new job, I've been working in this new office in Santa Monica which I walk to (sweet!), and I just happened to find myself examining a copy of US Weekly. We don't have a lot of magazines up in here, so cut me a break. Anyway, this is the extent of political coverage in it - I looked through the whole thing for something mildly political and/or cerebral.</p>


<p>Here it is -<br />
<b><br />
Heidi Montag, who has been hailed as a feminist hero, is voting for John McCain. 'I am a republican, and he has a lot of experience', says Heidi, who grew up in Colorado. </b></p>


<p>That's it - that is the entire reference. Young girls everywhere are being taught that a vacuous statement like that could (a) come from someone hailed as a 'feminist hero', (b) somehow equate to political awareness. Sheesh.</p>


<p>Oh yeah, and by the way, she has been <i>hailed by some</i> as a 'feminist hero' because - wait for it - she had a mean boyfriend once. I swear, you can't make this stuff up. I don't know who she is, apparently she is on TV somewhere, but she is being quoted by a publication with a readership in the millions that targets a very specific tween + teen demographic, and that makes her a significant role model as sad as it is to say that. Conclusion: we need better role models.<br />
<i><br />
Melman ... went further to argue that military production has a kind of viral impact across the economy, that sickens the whole system. One example: if investors see higher returns in military industries, they will shift their investments away from other industries, leaving them starved for capital.<br />

        <title>John "McSame" McCain</title>
        <link>2008/04/john-mcsame-mccain</link>
        <description><p>I have posted previously about Hilary and Barack, so it's only fair to say something about John McCain.<br /><br />
Of course, there's not a whole lot to say, except that he would make the same kind of jackass president that George is. Sadly, that fact is barely enough to make the news, what with all the hollerin' and carryings-on over in the Finance sector, except we're not even hearing much of a story about that these days. So I guess that just means those good, honest people in the media must just have their hands full of free shwag, fruit baskets and cashier's checks. Anyway, here's a good read from my favorite blog site <a href="http://smirkingchimp.com/thread/13838">Smirking Chimp</a>.<br />
<i><br />
Following in the footsteps of George W. "Double Dip Recession" Bush comes John "McSame" McCain, who admits in public that economics isn't his strong suit, but nevertheless, he tells The Wall Street Journal that his solution for the economic trough we're entering is to make the Bush tax cuts permanent and cut corporate tax rates.</i><br /> <a href="http://smirkingchimp.com/thread/13838">read more</a><br />

ps - the heart, gist, and catch-phrase from this post was lifted secretly from the political writings of one <a href="http://smirkingchimp.com/author/brian_morton">Brian Morton</a> - which is probably a pseudonym (and if it isn't, it should be).<br /></p>

        <description><p>Although I didn&#039;t actually end up using it, this little snippet did work like a charm.</p>


<p>&lt;%= periodically_call_remote(:update =&gt; "preview",:frequency =&gt; 3, :url =&gt; {:controller =&gt; &#039;resource&#039;, :action =&gt; &#039;highlights&#039;, :id =&gt; @facebook_id }) %&gt;</p>


<p>Just put it in a view somewhere, and it will call your remote function and update whatever you want at a given interval.</p>

        <title>Ruby snippet for a .collect call instead of .each</title>
        <link>2008/03/ruby-snippet-for-a-collect-call-instead-of-each</link>
        <description><p>This works great. This is the best replacement for a &#039;For&#039; loop or one of those .each calls. This dumps out a &#039;br&#039; separated list of links for all the sub-industries in each category. I set up the model call to return a recordset, tie it to @tv_sub in the controller, and this is all it takes to get those links set up in the view:</p>


<p>&lt;% if @tv_sub -%&gt;<br />
  &lt;%= @tv_sub.collect{|si|<br />
      link_to (si.name, url_for(:action =&gt; &#039;browse&#039;, :category =&gt; &#039;tv&#039;, :sub_industry=&gt;si.name))<br />
                  }.join(&#039;&#039;)<br />
          -%&gt;<br />
&lt;% end -%&gt;</p>


<p>And this is the model call:</p>


<p>def self.find_sub_tv<br />
  SubIndustry.find(:all, :order=&gt;&#039;name&#039;, :conditions =&gt; ["industry_id = ?", TV_ID])<br />

        <title>Back in the studio</title>
        <link>2008/02/back-in-the-studio</link>
        <description><p>I am almost ready to mix my new album <a href="http://axelradio.com/album/fast-train">Fast Train</a>.</p>


<p>This is my first album ever that will have been recorded entirely analog - no computers anywhere!</p>


<p>I've got three reels of 2 inch tape in my closet, and it feels positively retro. Not to mention the sound - this is the biggest sounding recording of mine, ever.</p>


<p>I've been working with a few different engineers, Mike Terry and Doug Messenger, and we've been talking about getting a new sound going for me. I like to change it up for every recording.</p>


<p>Swexico (2004) was my first recording, and it is now officially out of stock.

the previous albums:

<p><a href="http://axelradio.com/album/permanent-friday-night">Permanent Friday Night</a> (2005) has a very blues/folk slant to it, and is a real tribute to my early years here in Los Angeles. It is a long play, and really feels like a trip through my past - it's very autobiographical and honest.</p>
<p><a href="http://axelradio.com/album/arms-around-the-river">Arms Around the River</a> (2007) is quite a bit more polished than the first two, and has more of a dreamy sound to it. It is probably most akin to folk/pop records like David Gray's A New Day at Midnight.</p>
<p><a href="http://axelradio.com/album/fast-train">Fast Train</a> (2008) will achieve a middle ground between the last two records - taking off a few coats of polish and finding the organic warmth that you can only get from those old 2 inch tape machines, and featuring some of my best writing yet. It is set to be released in May but I will preview at least a track or two on my <a href="http://inmusic.org">podcast</a>.</p>

        <title>Obama and Clinton Pudding</title>
        <link>2008/02/obama-and-clinton-pudding</link>
        <description><p>If the proof is in the pudding, then here is some pudding:</p>


<p>========<br />
Clinton<br />
========</p>


<p>Senator Clinton, who has served only one full term - 6yrs. - and another year campaigning, has managed to author and pass into law - 20 - twenty pieces of legislation in her first six years.</p>


<p>These bills can be found on the website of the Library of Congress <a href="http://www.thomas.loc.gov" title="www.thomas.loc.gov">www.thomas.loc.gov</a>, but to save you trouble, I'll post them here for you.</p>


<p>1. Establish the Kate Mullany National Historic Site.<br />
2. Support the goals and ideals of Better Hearing and Speech Month.<br />
3. Recognize the Ellis Island Medal of Honor.<br />
4. Name courthouse after Thurgood Marshall.<br />
5. Name courthouse after James L. Watson.<br />
6. Name post office after Jonn A. O'Shea.<br />
7. Designate Aug. 7, 2003, as National Purple Heart Recognition Day.<br />
8. Support the goals and ideals of National Purple Heart Recognition Day.<br />
9. Honor the life and legacy of Alexander Hamilton on the bicentennial of his death.<br />
10. Congratulate the Syracuse Univ. Orange Men's Lacrosse Team on winning the championship.<br />
11. Congratulate the Le Moyne College Dolphins Men's Lacrosse Team on winning the championship.<br />
12. Establish the 225th Anniversary of the American Revolution Commemorative Program.<br />
13. Name post office after Sergeant Riayan A. Tejeda.<br />
14. Honor Shirley Chisholm for her service to the nation and express condolences on her death.<br />
15. Honor John J. Downing, Brian Fahey, and Harry Ford, firefighters who lost their lives on duty. Only five of Clinton's bills are, more substantive.<br />
16. Extend period of unemployment assistance to victims of 9/11.<br />
17. Pay for city projects in response to 9/11<br />
18. Assist landmine victims in other countries.<br />
19. Assist family caregivers in accessing affordable respite care.<br />
20. Designate part of the National Forest System in Puerto Rico as protected in the wilderness preservation system.</p>


<p>There you have it, facts straight from the Senate Record.</p>


<p>=============<br />
Obama<br />
=============</p>


<p>During the first - 8 - eight years of his elected service he sponsored over 820 bills. He introduced</p>


<p>233 regarding healthcare reform,<br />
125 on poverty and public assistance,<br />
112 crime fighting bills,<br />
97 economic bills,<br />
60 human rights and anti-discrimination bills,<br />
21 ethics reform bills,<br />
15 gun control,<br />
6 veterans affairs and many others.</p>


<p>NY TImes Obama's record in the Illinois Senate</p>


<p>His first year in the U.S. Senate, he authored 152 bills and co-sponsored another 427. These inculded:</p>


<p>1. The Coburn-Obama Government Transparency Act of 2006 - became law,<br />
2. The Lugar-Obama Nuclear Non-proliferation and Conventional Weapons Threat Reduction Act, - became law,<br />
3. The Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act, passed the Senate,<br />
4. The 2007 Government Ethics Bill, - became law,<br />

        <title>Q4 2007 Analysis</title>
        <link>2008/02/q4-2007-analysis</link>
        <description><p>I am finally keeping track.</p>


<p>It is finally that time, since the launch of my <a href="http://digbox.net">digbox.net</a> / <a href="http://digbox.net">codeboxer.com</a> Tech Blog in November of 2007 I have seen some upswings in activity across all of my sites, so in preparation for the day when I can actually just do what I love for a living without having to go in to the office I have compiled a Q4 Analysis.</p>

<div align="justify">
Just for the record, I'm not really  against Obama, I just thought we could do better. I do recognize how monumental a black president would be for this country, but it just reminds me of how excited we were in 2006 about the Democratic sweep in Congress - and look where that got us.
<p>Anyway, I just hope this is more than another chance to go through the motions. I want to believe. Sure, I'd like a Dennis Kucinich, or a Ralph Nader, but I suppose I'll settle for a Barack and just try to look at the bright side.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, I think the nicest thing I can say about Barack is that he's no G.W. Bush - and that, my friends, ain't nothin - I guess that's a good place to start. That, and if he really means what he says, then we may get our <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15358236/page/2/">habeus corpus</a> back, and I think there are a good number of additional issues that would we see eye to eye on. So I'm cautiously optimistic.

        <title>Among the Divinities Shall Ye Be Remembered Lavinia</title>
        <link>2008/02/among-the-divinities-shall-ye-be-remembered-lavinia</link>
        <description><p>I thought to buy you a trinket<br />
to express the warmth in my heart for you.<br />
Some small token that might find a home<br />
next to your bed.<br />
There were toys, lawn-gnomes<br />
and rocking chairs<br />
swaying in the cold April wind.<br />
This life falls short of you<br />
in my fleeting paradise beneath the spotlight<br />
I remain incomplete. There is more<br />
to my dream than was planned<br />
I did not mean to love you<br />
without my kingdom in place<br />
I have no control.<br />
Not over this grey morning<br />
or the way the sun shines<br />
not over my heart<br />
which knows only your name<br />
I found nothing to offer you but myself<br />
and this handful of rain<br />
tears from the Kansas City sky<br />
symbols of a love<br />
eternal</p>


<p><small>written from the road in Missouri, summer 2006</small></p>


<p>original title:</p>


<p>&#039;Lavinia, Lavinia, Lavinia, Howsoever Beatest Thine Heart Among the Divinities Shall Ye Be Remembered, Lavinia&#039;</p>

        <description><p>After over 9 months, literally the last 4 weeks non-stop, every day, I bring you - the migration. In effect. 5000 + lines of PL/SQL sexiness. This little puppy brought about a million company records and 300,000 student records over into the new Ruby on Rails schema which were then written into over 8 million contact, user, address, and account records.</p>

<p>With the only two remaining Democrats leaning middle-right and middle-righter, I like the sound of a Nader candidacy. I heard him on the radio, and he used two bad-ass scrabble words in the same sentence - pernicious and profligate. Sweet. Take that, Georgie. I swear, it will be the beginning of a new age when we finally have smart people making the decisions again. Good on ya, Ralph.</p>

Despite about 30 years of precedent, the Bush regime decides to deny California's request to go above and beyond Federal greenhouse emissions regulations, which by all accounts are inadequate. The reason? It would be confusing.<br />
Thanks George, that's a really good one. We can't clean up the air, it's too confusing!<br />

        <description><p>You all know how hard it can be to get good press, so here's a new review posted just last month:<br />

<blockquote>
I already like an album that has a song called Impeach Bush.
These songs were written around the time of the London Terrorist attack in 2005. He was there and saw how it affected the people living in and around [London].
Axel has a sort of slow, drawly vocal style. His voice is very infectious. I could listen to it all day. The songwriting is bluesy, with lots of rhythm and heartfelt lyrics. Good stuff.
</blockquote>

<br />
It is short but sweet.</p>

<p><strong>haiku<br />
05.23.07</strong><br />
I have a firepit now. So I'm writing haiku about it.
<i>
The taming of fire<br />
We are all turned to ashes<br />
in the hot center<br />
</i></p>

<br />


<br />


<p>In other news, I'm going to Europe for my cousin's wedding. Germany. I'll be playing piano at the reception in Stuttgart.</p>

<br />


<p>I will also be doing some performances at the Santa Monica Farmer's Market this year, making the big bucks (I just found out today).</p>

<p><strong>a poem written in Mae Sot<br />
04.01.07</strong><br /></p>

<br />


<p>I found this today in a notebook I had with me over Christmas.
This was written the morning after I spent my first night in Mae Sot (Thailand).</p>

<br /><br /><br />


<p><i>A dog barks at the morning prayer<br />
and the sky remembers everything<br /></p>

<p>the smoke-filled houses<br />
leaned against each other<br />
the wild green hand of nature<br />
clutching at humanity. Go ahead<br />
and die, says the world<br />
we will not find you<br />
in your toothpick temples<br />
eating rice and leaves. Your children<br />
are not lucky enough to feel<br />
the breath of medicine.<br />
There is no love to spare.</i><br /></p>

<p>The pictures from Thailand and Burma are now here. <br /><br /></p>

<p>The story:<br /><br />
Last year in December, both Lavinia and I traveled to Thailand to visit her mother Selia who has volunteered for almost a year now as a teacher's teacher for an organization called <b>The Curriculum Project</b>. We spent most of our time in Mae Sot, which is an important border town between Thailand and Burma.<br />
Many of the Burmese refugee camps are in this area. Most Burmese refugees are of Karen descent, and are the only remaining freedom fighters against the heavy-handed Burmese government - since the Buddhist Karenni faction sold out to the Burmese military regime just a few years ago. There is always hope that these kind-hearted Burmese peasants will find peace and prosperity some day soon. Click the contact link above left if you would like to donate directly to the orphans in the photos depicted here.<br /><br />
While we were there, General Bo Mya passed away in his late seventies, who was easily the most important spokesperson for the Christian Karen faction. Bo Mya was quite literally a folk hero and military legend. Attending his funeral in Burma (Myanmar) was a once-in-a-lifetime experience for Lavinia, her brother John, her mother Selia and I.</p>

        <title>Some Facts About Obama</title>
        <link>2007/12/some-facts-about-obama</link>
        <description><p align="justify"><i>Of course, underneath the veneer of fresh-faced optimism that Obama is pushing -- note that the word "idealism" isn't appropriate here, because Obama isn't selling idealism so much as a kind of reinvigorated, feel-good pragmatism -- there operates a massive, well-oiled political machine no less ruthless and ambitious than that of his establishment rival, Hillary Clinton. Obama has raised $80 million, and it would be a grievous mistake to describe his candidacy as a grass-roots affair, particularly when he counts among his bundlers many of the lobbyists and political-finance pros who buttress the Clinton run.</i></p>


<p>&lt;!--break--><i><br />
<p align="justify">Even a cursory glance at Obama's money men is enough to confirm that fact. The list includes Wall Street hotshots from Lehman Brothers, Oppenheimer and Co., and Citigroup, a smattering of Hollywood players and Native American casino interests, representatives of big pharmaceuticals and the insurance sector -- in short, all the major food groups of reviled corporate influence-hunters.</p>
<p align="justify">
Worse still, Obama's financial backing is reflected in some of his Senate votes and campaign positions, including most notably his support for expanding NAFTA to Peru, limiting the ability of injured workers and consumers to sue for damages, and pouring federal funds into E85 corn-based ethanol, an alternative fuel for which the market is dominated by the Illinois-based Archer Daniels Midland Company. More than once I heard Obama give stirring speeches, only to mar them with plugs for ethanol. </p></i></p>


<p><a href="http://smirkingchimp.com/thread/11604">read more by Matt Taibbi</a><br /></p>


<p align="justify">
Just for the record, I am not badmouthing Obama - Hilary, I think, would be MUCH WORSE as a president. But seriously, why can't we talk about Kucinich? He's the only real choice. Barack is a self-proclaimed Centrist. He's in bed with big money. He doesn't have a progressive bone in his body. The best case scenario for Barack is that he indirectly <i>enables</i> progressive change. I literally heard this from a NPR pundit. At this point in our national suicide, are we really looking for <i>a chance</i> at 'indirect' progressivism? Can a guy like Barack really take the Fizers and Wellpoints of the world to task? I don't think so. He is no FDR. He is barely to the left of Reagan - he's just not a sociopath (like Shrubby is). Is that really how far the bar has dropped?<br /><br />
Meanwhile, read this about Kucinich and his career as Mayor of Cleveland:</p>


<p align="justify">
<i>He was elected mayor of Cleveland in 1977 on the promise to save the city's municipally-owned electric system which offered customers significantly lower rates than the private utility.   A year later, Cleveland's banks demanded that he sell the city's 70 year-old municipally-owned electric system to its private competitor (in which the banks had a financial interest) as a precondition of extending credit to the city.</i></p>


<p align="justify">
The attempted political blackmail failed as did several assassination attempts.  He remembered his parents counting out coins on the dresser and refused to sell the people's power.  In an incident unprecedented in modern American politics, the Cleveland banks plunged the city into default for a mere $15 million despite being offered triple collateral to protect the loan.</p>


<p align="justify">
The principled stand destroyed his political career.   He lost his reelection bid.  He was demonized as the mayor who threw Cleveland into default.  Fifteen years later, the citizens of Cleveland - recognizing  he had saved them hundreds of millions of dollars in municipal power bills and also forced the private utility to keep bills low to compete - voted him into the Ohio Senate.   His campaign signs featured  a light bulb and the expression "Because he was right.”  In 1998 the Cleveland City Council honored Dennis for "..having the courage and foresight to refuse to sell the city's municipal electric system.” </p>


<p>That's who we need in the White House.</p>

        <description><p>These are ominous developments that suggest a likely real or contrived homeland terror attack severe enough to warrant suspending the Constitution and declaring martial law with the public acquiescing out of fear.<br />
&lt;!--break--> If it comes, anyone may be targeted as a "national security" threat, indefinitely detained in a camp, and no evidence is needed for proof. The state and military will be empowered by law to act preventively through mass roundups and detentions that appears the reason for three test-run FALCON operations.</p>

        <description><p>...of the widespread voting irregularities that have become the sad, twilight-zone 'norm', I have a quote for you. This was taken from my favorite blogging site, <a href="http://smirkingchimp.com">SmirkingChimp.com</a> -<br />
<i><br />
The final official tally for Bush---less than 119,000 votes out of 5.4 million cast---varied by 6.7% from exit poll results, which showed a Kerry victory. Exit polls in 2004 were designed to have a margin of error of about 1%.</i></p>


<p>In various polling stations in Democrat-rich inner city precincts in Youngstown and Columbus, voters who pushed touch screens for Kerry saw Bush's name light up. A wide range of discrepancies on both electronic and paper balloting systems leaned almost uniformly toward the Bush camp. Voting procedures regularly broke down in inner city and campus areas known to be heavily Democratic.</p>


<p>In direct violation of standing federal election law, 56 of Ohio's 88 counties have since destroyed all or part of their 2004 election data. The materials were additionally protected by a federal court injunction in the King-Lincoln-Bronzeville federal civil rights lawsuit (in which we are attorney and plaintiff). To date, no state or federal prosecutions have resulted from this wholesale destruction of presidential election records, including 1.6 million ballots, cast and uncast, needed for definitive auditing procedures. However, two Cuyahoga County (Cleveland) election officials have been convicted of felony manipulation of an official recount. The Cleveland Plain-Dealer, the state's largest newspaper, recently editorialized that there is "no evidence" the 2004 election was stolen, but omitted mention of the destruction of the electoral records by more than half the counties in the state. The Plain-Dealer and other mainstream media have consistently ignored findings by the Free Press and others indicating widespread manipulation and theft of the kind Brunner has now confirmed was eminently do-able within the Ohio system.</p>

        <title>Inexpensive MAX queries in PL SQL</title>
        <link>2007/12/inexpensive-max-queries-in-pl-sql</link>
        <description><p>This was a trick that one of our contractors showed me here at Monstertrak today. Basically, here&#039;s the gist. you&#039;ve got a join that you need to make, but you only ever want one record to return - you need to restrict the join to return one - and only one - sister record.<br />
Common logic would have you doing a group by query against said table as a derived table, on the primary key and whatever other field encompasses the info you need to enforce your logic, and doing a self-join against that same table to pull in the rest of the fields you need, and then joining that back against the table you needed to join to in the first place.</p>


<p>Here&#039;s what that looks like -</p>


<p>SELECT MAIN_TABLE.*, JOIN_TABLE.*<br />
FROM MAIN_TABLE<br />
     ,JOIN_TABLE<br />
     ,(SELECT MAX(ID) ID, USERNAME FROM JOIN_TABLE GROUP BY ID, USERNAME) JOIN_TABLE_GROUP_BY<br />
WHERE MAIN_TABLE.ID = JOIN_TABLE.FOREIGN_KEY<br />
AND JOIN_TABLE.ID = JOIN_TABLE_GROUP_BY.ID</p>


<p>There is a better way. You can save yourself the self-join by concatenating all of your needed fields into one calculated field, and doing the MAX() calculation with only ONE field in the GROUP BY. You put your criteria field far left, pad it enough to not chop any digits, concatenate in the rest of what you want, and then SUBSTR it back out in the end. Genius.</p>


<p>select c.id,<br />
c.email,<br />
trim(substr(v.val,13,10)) eaid,<br />
trim(substr(v.val,23)) username<br />
from MAIN_TABLE c,<br />
(select max(rpad(company_id,12)||rpad(id,10)||username) val from JOIN_TABLE ea<br />
where ea.LAST_LOGIN &gt; &#039;1-JAN-2006&#039;<br />
group by ea.company_id) v<br />
where c.id = trim(substr(v.val,1,12))<br />
and length(c.email) &gt; 3<br />
order by c.email asc, c.id desc;</p>

        <description><p>...are on the way. I was just in the studio again at <a href="http://newmonkeystudio.com" target="_blank">New Monkey</a> (which is where I recorded Arms Around the River) and we took a good crack at laying down the basic tracks. I think this album is going to blow everything else out of the water. Of course, I say that every time I make an album. Anyway, check out <a href="http://axelradio.com/track/les-yeux-gris">Les Yeux Gris</a> for a little taste. See you in the Spring!</p>

        <link>2007/09/working-on-sunset</link>
        <description><p>I work on Sunset now<br />
where dreams die and take shape<br />
where highways are twisted at the throat<br />
of the green that once was<br />
sometimes with more choice<br />
comes less freedom<br />
more sugar in place of food<br />
sirens for a handshake<br />
bright lights casting longer shadows<br />
soon the earth will erupt<br />
and reshape the landscapes<br />
in her likeness<br />
to invade the invaders<br />
with mountains for fingers<br />
she brushes the cities<br />
from her brow. As if<br />
to invent a simple fabric<br />
between God and Man<br />
she turns over<br />
her bed</p>

<p>That was a good day. All love, sunshine, and hula hoops. I might have seen a few jugs of wine going around. The coffee was delicious. I loved this festival. Please visit <a href="http://newearthfest.com/" target="_blank">New Earth Fest.com</a> for more info and to support this musical cooperative.<br /><br />
Here is a song from that performance:<br /></p>

<p>Missouri is a beautiful place.<br /><br />
Wisconsin and Minnesota aren't so bad either.<br />
I just got back to Los Angeles, so it might take me a while to put up some more shots but they'll be up by the end of the week. We also got some video from a few of the shows. The tour was a total success. Special thanks to:</p>


<p><b>Nate</b> for hooking it up in Madison<br />
<b>Nick</b> for setting up the <b>New Earth</b> show<br />
<b>Christopher</b> at the Weary Traveller</p>


<p>We sold cds, we spread the word, and we realized that I should probably do my version of <i>Hallelujah</i> at every show. Good to know. :)<br />

<p>
I love being on the road. Songs write themselves when you are traveling. September is my favorite month to see the country.<br /><br />
I haven't played a show in Madison since I left in 1999. This is also a first time having a partner in crime on the road with me (Lavinia is coming along). We are going to have a great time.<br /><br />
I'll try to post updates from the road.<br /><br />
See you in the heartland!<br /><br />

        <link>2007/07/april-sonnet</link>
        <description><p>I leave you in your perfect circle<br />
you left me where I couldn't cross<br />
grateful for my piece of sunshine<br />
but knowing how much more is lost.<br />
Everyone comes up together<br />
everyone goes down alone<br />
with half a life to run away<br />
and barely time to find a home.<br />
Somehow we have made our peace<br />
dodging the forms of our skeptic souls<br />
I think tonight no one will bleed<br />
and then perhaps no one grows old.<br />
With simple words we scale a sonnet<br />
balanced, all our hopes upon it.</p>

        <title>After the Derby</title>
        <link>2007/07/after-the-derby</link>
        <description><p>God I've waited for this<br />
The rush of sounds this madness<br />
Of purpose in such perfect stealth<br />
And when I understand the greatness<br />
Of this world in simple terms<br />
The presence of kindred spirits<br />
Moments of authenticity<br />
The birth of a revolution</p>

        <title>Krister Axel at the Derby</title>
        <link>2007/07/krister-axel-at-the-derby</link>
        <description><p>I love the Derby. It is old and rustic like a rundown barn in the middle of a freeway except the roof is built like a bee nest and the shadows fall wherever they can.<br /><br />
We came and went like an afternoon tempest except we left a few cds behind and I kissed someone on the cheek. Ordering a drink from that bar somehow reminds me of leaning up against the Formosa cafe dressed the 50's detective and lighting a match off my shoe. Champagne, and coffee for the horses.<br /><br />
Let us all become lost for a short time together, and awaken to the future that invades us.<br /><br /></p>

        <description><p><strong>oBriens Pub in Santa Monica<br />
12.01.06</strong><br /></p>

<br />


<p>I played a few songs along with some other guests, most notably my good friend and killer songwriter Jay Sousa from 50 Cent Haircut. I sit in with his band on keys whenever I can. The night was very cool. Being back at O'Briens will always remind me of my Paper Sun days.</p>

<strong>New Shows<br /></p>

<p>11.19.06</strong><br /></p>

<br />


<p>I'll be in San Fran this weekend for a show, I'm looking forward to that. <b>Arms Around the River</b> will be mastered on Dec. 7th
 and then I'll send it out to be pressed - the cd release party will be at the <b>Hotel Cafe</b> in Hollywood early next year.</p>

<br />


<p>These are some of my best songs yet - Marc Moreau did the mixing, along with my friend Brandon Krueger who mixed a few tracks and Cythia Catania who had a hand in it as well.</p>

<br />


<p>This will be the third album I've produced and I am really getting the hang of it.</p>

<br />


<p>For the record, the songs that I have had playing from my site for the last few months are not the songs that will be featured on the album - I have some outtakes, some
really esoteric Krister Axel songs, and some live stuff available here on the website that WILL NOT be featured on the next album (not all of it, at least). I'm sorry if I did not make that clear early on.</p>

<br />


<p>I guess maybe there really is a market for the Krister Axel version of <b>Georgia On My Mind</b>.<br /><br />
I suppose I'll have to put out a cover album <i>a la</i> <b>Perfect Day</b> by Chris Whitley. That'll be my next project.<br /><br /></p>

<strong>The Freeze<br />
09.11.06</strong><br /><br /></p>

<p><small>I found this in an old notebook, dated 05.17.1997 (written in Madison, WI).</small><br /><br />
just this little stash of survival</p>

<br />never had a moment to think


<br />radio voices sound like someone I know


<br />moonlight makes me want to have a drink


<br />I listen to the rhythm of the traffic


<br />hiding in the silence I project


<br />push me through the womb of the future


<br />bear me as an infant to protect


<br />an island on the ocean planet 'solo'


<br />wailing of the unborn tragedy


<br />wiping from my eyes the mess of martyrs


<br />the burden of my passage through the freeze


<br />

For the record, I never cancel a show. I have to go back to March 10th, 1995, for the last show cancellation that
I was ever party to. Over ten years ago - at <b>The Chamber</b>, Madison, WI (no longer there). Good times.<br /><br />
Anyway, the reason was that I had an invitation to the Playboy Mansion that I couldn't refuse. So thank you all for being so understanding.</p>

<p>This is Hef's pet Toucan. He's got monkeys, rabbits, birds. It is literally a zoo. A really little one. I didn't like it at all. Very natural
looking, except of course for all the cages.<br /><br />
I hate to be judgemental, and I am not intimate with the details, but it does seem to me that if people like Hef each gave a small
but significant push for progressive politics instead of stuffing Toucans into cages, we might not be in quite the mess that we are now.
Anyway, thanks for the invite buddy. <br /><br />
So that's it and here I am - signing off from Hef's mini-zoo, where the playmates still wear the same outfits, but now in modern pastels.</p>

<strong>Sunset Boulevard<br /></p>

<p>08.15.06</strong><br /><br />
I work on Sunset now<br />
where dreams die and take shape<br />
where highways are twisted at the throat<br />
of the green that once was<br />
sometimes with more choice<br />
comes less freedom<br />
more sugar in place of food<br />
sirens for a handshake<br /></p>

<p>bright lights casting longer<br />
and longer shadows<br />
soon the earth will erupt<br />
and reshape the landscapes<br />
in her likeness<br />
to invade the invaders<br />
with mountains for fingers<br />
she brushes the cities<br />
from her brow. As if<br /></p>

<p>to invent a simple fabric<br />
between God and Man<br />
she turns over<br />
her bed<br /></p>

<strong>Jamaica<br />
08.07.06</strong><br /></p>

<br /> <font color="#666666"><small><i>August fights with bold teeth




<br />the rumor of a cold winter</i></font></small>


<br /><br />I don't know why I said that. It never gets cold in Los Angeles.


<br /><br />I was in Jamaica not much more than a month ago. It feels like much longer than that - it is amazing how long you can put things off for.


<p>We were there for the 4th of July and it was in full bloom, the sun was hot and the breeze was cold. The streets in the big cities were mostly
all right and the highway to Negril was almost new, but everywhere else there are holes in the street like missing teeth.
The land is so rich and green but the people are very poor. Buildings everywhere along the smaller highways stand in a half-constructed ethereal realm.
The whole western island seems to be in perpetual work-in-progress mode where the bags of gravel lay untended and the doors are all open as if the notice
came suddenly that there was no reason to work anymore.<br /><br />
We had a great time and Jamaica is a gorgeous country but it is a bit unsettling to know how much power money has been given in our society.<br />
Lavinia and I rented a car in Montego Bay and drove all the way to Treasure Beach. It was such a long drive that we decided to
split it up on the way back and stay in Negril for the night en route.</p>

<p>This is Lavinia, in all her hotness. There is not much more to say about this picture, she is the love of my life and it is also quite obvious that she is the sexiest woman that has ever lived. Here she is just outside <b>Jack Sprat's</b>. The water was very blue at that beach.
That was a good day.</p>

<br /><br />I brought my <i>Martin</i> and played it a lot. Lazy days.

<p>I got to play some music, I played a few songs during the set break one night at the hotel. It was totally unplanned and was a real highlight for me.
I met a jamaican musician named Toby One and we became friends. Cool man. His friend Wendell played tambourine and held the mic stand.</p>

<br />


<p>People all over the world are amazingly gracious and giving. Everyone we met was essentially kind. It is just a shame that such a beautiful
place can be in effect annexed by big-business tourism without the people of Jamaica ending up with much of anything at all.</p>

<p>These are the lyrics to my new song <i>Summer Drug</i>, in honor of my new friend <a href="http://www.KimDellavedova.com" target="_blank">Kim Dellavedova</a>.</p>

<br />


<p>We did a show together last week at <strong>The Stone</strong> and it was very cool. <i>Summer Drug</i> was the first song I played and the one Kim liked the best. As it turns out we are both mad for <a href="http://www.chriswhitley.com/" target="_blank">Chris Whitley</a>.

<p>Kim tells me there is a video rental shop in Melbourne where she grew up that is constantly playing <strong>Loco Girl</strong> and other songs off of <strong>Dirt Floor</strong> for the customers, and if you can guess the name of the song they will give you a free rental. If only I lived next to a place like that where they serve drinks.</p>

<p><i>Peace for the winter I pray for you</p>

I'll say good night but I don't mean mine<br />
You're a summer drug</p>

<br />I guess that's good enough<br /><br />


<p>You're still blind from the summer flame</p>

<br />


<p>love-drunk and whisky-tame</p>

<br />


<p>on that old yesterday</p>

<br />


<p>you wake up and see the sky</p>

you're not just wasting time<br /><br />

<p>Everyone is confirmed for <strong><i>Roots Rock for Lovers</i></strong>.</p>

<br />


<p>I have always wanted to play a show at <strong>the Stone</strong>. It is right in Hollywood and I know the lights
will be shining on us in the hip dive room of our time. Hollywood is the new West Hollywood which puts Koreatown in
as the next Hollywood.<br />
Anyway <strong>Sally Jaye</strong> is a total heartbreaker, <strong>Shawn Pander</strong> is like molasses on
broken glass and <strong>Brandon Krandon</strong> will make you believe. We got everything
from a diddled-eyed Joe to a damned if I know.</p>

<br />I'm glad you'll be going. They serve 4 kinds of whisky and I plan to try every one.


<br />


<br />Get there early, stay late and drink just like it's Saturday.


<br />I will be playing acoustic guitar for the first time in a while, and if the wind blows right I may get my


<p> harmonium shipped from England just in time to play it for you.</p>

<p><strong>06.22.06</strong><br /><br />
I was talking to a friend of mine last week, and he asked me what I've been up to.<br />
I replied that I was adding some informative current events
links to my home page in such a way that I can update and append to them often and easily.
His reply was: <i>what are you doing that for</i>?<br /><br /></p>

<ul>
<li>which I thought was sort of odd. We are literally exploding the federal deficit, funneling hundreds of billions
of taxpayer dollars every year into wrong-headed priorities for a clumsy military. International diplomacy is at an all-time low
and the value of the dollar is eroding but you wouldn't know it by watching TV or reading any of the major newspapers. <br />
Not to mention the completely overt lawlessness of a power-drunk and peerlessly incompetent administration.<br />
Yet, there is no perceived need for unbiased information.<br />
That's a lot of kool-aid.</li>

<p>Coronado is very cool. Many thanks to Nancy Peace for hooking us up with a great gig.<br /><br />
Tomorrow the band is tracking with an A-list engineer in a badass recording studio and I am really looking forward to it.<br /><br />
I'll keep you posted.</p>

<p><strong>05.15.06</strong><br /><br /></p>

<br />Yesterday was my birthday.


<br />




<br />Life is really good these days. My new album <strong>iMTHEGUN</strong> is coming along nicely. 


<p>I have a recording session coming up at <a href="http://www.newmonkeystudio.com/" target="_blank">NEW MONKEY STUDIOS</a>,
which some of us will remember as the studio that was
a labor of love for <strong>Elliot Smith</strong>, that tragic and beautiful poet.</p>

<br /><br />


<p>It will be a very deep experience to explore my own creativity as a songwriter and composer on his beloved keyboards. I have
always found that every instrument has its own voice and personality, and this is even more true for vintage keyboards like antique pianos
 from 1917 and a 50's-era harmonium. Sigh.
 <br /> <br />
 Every time I meet a new piano, a song is written. This has never failed me.<br />
 The best part is that I am finally doing a recording to tape in a place where I know the air will be full
 of muses and electricity and above all, microphones.
 <br /><br /></p>

<p>I won't be gigging very much this summer, but if you live near San Diego you can catch a show with the full band
on <strong>Coronado Island</strong>.<br />
It's an outdoor Cancer Benefit called <strong>RELAY FOR LIFE</strong> on SAT JUNE 10th.<br /><br />
Yes, I'm having two birthday parties;<br />
and yes, I quit the <strong>Cheyenne Kimball</strong> band, for reasons that shall remain private - I will say only that we parted on good terms and I wish her nothing but the best. <br>
I think on the <strong>MHD Network</strong> they are still airing a live show that I did with her in Breckinridge this past January.</p>

<br />Highlights:


<p><li>Witnessing a true legend perform, Ian McLagan.</li>
<li>Jamming with John Popper. He literally walked in off the street while I was playing a song, and stepped up to the mic with his harmonica. It was gorgeous.</li>
<li>Singing <i>We'll Sweep Out The Ashes In the Morning</i> with <a href="http://www.naimee.cjb.net/" target="_blank">Naimee Coleman</a> at the Gram Parsons tribute.</li></p>

The amazing line-up musicians that I will be performing with includes members of Wilco, The Minus 5, and REM. This whole weekend in Austin is going to be completely surreal.</li></p>

<pre><code>    I've been playing keys lately with Sony/Epic artist Cheyenne Kimball and it's pretty awesome. In the past month I've met some very cool people from both Sony and MTV. Cheyenne's new show on MTV will be airing early this summer, called &lt;strong&gt;Cheyenne 15&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;
  Yup, she's 15 and she rocks.   &lt;br /&gt;
  So while I'm writing more songs for my next album I'll be on the road with Cheyenne. Here are some photos from our show at the Breckenridge Riverwalk Center for the MHD Network&lt;strong&gt; Music with Altitude&lt;/strong&gt; Concert Series. It was about 10 degrees Fahrenheit but who cares - this is rock and roll, baby.&lt;br /&gt;

<p>      This was a first for me, everywhere we went there were cameras. It's fun for about 45 seconds and then it gets annoying. Poor Cheyenne didn't have a moment's peace.

With opinions about my state<br />
Staying up late</p>


<p>I don't know where I am<br />
This voice beneath the hum<br />
I spend my nights alone with words<br />
The echo of a drum<br />
I love the way we talk<br />
This language of the soul</p>


<p>I want to thank you for saying my name</p>


<p>Some thirst for perfection<br />
guides my days. Like noise<br />
in long breaths of scented smoke<br />
the poison of poetic lust<br />
grows in my blood like a weed<br />
I accept this. Every hour<br />
Pushing with what strength I have<br />
Against yesterday</p>


<p>Where once was a child is now<br />
A fool. He follows heat<br />
And questions what is fire<br />
I am this champion of doubt<br />
Against what can't be named<br />
I accept this. With my words<br />
Construction of simple color<br />
The unknown voice</p>


<p>Never seen. Decides what is real</p>


<p>And the sad eyes of exhaustion<br />
ever wise. In this life will be</p>

<p>09.15.05</p>

<p>  In September I see boots before
  the first rain, vast migrant flocks
  flying before the last late sunset
  threatens: a strange, nervous pox
  which might never find a certain cure
  where the stricken fly in nervous flocks</p>

<p>  In September I can't focus, I
  am estranged, staring out
  at the passional leaves so proud
  to be falling so many
  dreams happily dying and by
  each day these old colors flushing out.</p>

<p>  Is that not the way, in September
  of all things answering to
  love? To be sudden, elegant
  and trampled like the fallen truth
  in September when time is so fast

<p>  08.15.05 Write More Songs<br></p>

<p>
The last days of summer in Los Angeles. It's been good to be back. <br>
I have two songs that just made it on a to an Indie movie directed by my friend Ryan Byrne, details to follow.<br> 
I'm back in the studio with my friend Babyhead, working on <b>I'm the Gun</b> and <b>Always a Circle</b>. 
I'm also sitting in at <a href="http://www.room5lounge.com/" target="_blank"><b>Room 5</b></a> tonight with some friends (Joel Eckels, Jay Nash and Shane Alexander), come by if you're in the area. We're starting at 8pm. <br><br>

<b>Permanent Friday Night</b> is now available on <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/permanent-friday-night/id399848805"><b>iTunes</b></a> .<br>
That's nice.

<p>07.14.05 London Tragedy = Hope<br><p>
  <br>

<p>  <br>
  London is just a gorgeous city, plain and simple. This is a fact. <br>
  <br>
Being a lover of distant places, my whole experience there was sort of bittersweet because of course it wasn't about me at all. The day after I got there, some bombs went off on the Underground and on a bus, and the whole city went into a state of shock. There was no way to get around the city, all the means of transportation had been shut down, and the show that I had come to do was cancelled because there would have been no one there. Suddenly, my whole agenda as a performer and a songwriter was made to seem very petty, and I was glad to be alive. I wrote a lot of lyrics, and spent some time exploring what is important to me. This ancient, vibrant, aesthetic masterpiece of a city was wounded and I could do nothing. I don't know what I expected to happen, but in the end what I remember is the kindness of everyone I met.</p></p>

<p> I'm thinking of the city
  with its arms around the river
  with no end and no beginning

  like a chain of stars
  It's trying to tell me something
  about the light between two lovers
  the light that's on your face
all you have to do
shine on for me
  if you can't afford to sleep

  I'll be the push that brings you back
  it's Saturday
  and there's something in the air
  I don't believe that we are lost
I don't believe that we are lost</p>


<p>And I took a lot of pictures. That first day of the tragedy when the streets were swollen with sad faces and the sun came out in the afternoon I was mesmerized, taking pictures of all the beauty I could fit onto a camera lense. The flowers, the facades, the trees, the monuments - cathedrals tucked away like toy houses, and everywhere the proud and worn face of centuries. I am completely in love with this city.</p>

<p>06.13.05 NXNE in Toronto and the House of Blues<br></p>

<p>It was another one of those weekends. It went by in a flash of lights and humidity, the first Spring weather in Toronto and everyone was out in the streets. A beautiful city, alive in ways that we don't see in LA. The streets are packed and there are trams and cobblestones and the whole place has that lived-in feeling like a pair of jeans or an old fireplace.</p>


<table style="width:auto;"><tr><td><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/mN-b5rxUc94YZKmIhmplDzOVRZNSpnbS6833kNhGsxs?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_aJ4urxfgN9A/TSulyKe9LOI/AAAAAAAAFaI/R6K_wh-wbTI/s400/SUC50026.JPG" height="300" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td style="font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:11px; text-align:right">From <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/krister.axel/TorontoNXNE2005?authkey=Gv1sRgCP_7xprJqP68nAE&feat=embedwebsite">Toronto NXNE 2005</a></td></tr></table>

<p>We flew in on Friday, practiced Saturday afternoon and performed that night. It was truly inspiring the way we were received. the Canadians we met were all really cool and it was great to have so many people tell us that they really connected with the music. We laughed a lot this weekend. We made many new friends.</p>

<p>Toronto has a pretty unique sense of humor, almost everyone we met had us cracking up. I made some good contacts and I hope to get back over there soon. Coming back was sort of intense because my flight into LAX was delayed and I made it to the House of Blues for my show just a few minutes before Matty D, Mike Forrester and Mike Freas were going to figure out something to play without me. </p>


<p>It felt really good to park the car, walk right up and hit a nice 30 minute set. A good crowd, and I always love playing in the Foundation Room. I saw my friend Curtis Peoples who was there with Josh Kelly in the main room, Keaton Simons was on the bill and we traded cds. I love <a href="http://www.canofjam.com/" target="_top">Can of Jam</a> events, there's always a family vibe. See you at the beach in Hermosa! </p>

Everyone was there.<br>
It was like a family reunion. The energy of the crowd was electric and 
everyone was singing along to the point where I thought I was hearing voices.<br>
Check out this version on my new song I'm the Gun - this is where we had people screaming so loud they got picked
up in the mix from the onstage microphones that were facing the other way...<BR>

For those of you that aren't musicians, it is rare that you actually hear the crowd in a live recording unless you specifically put a microphone out in the crowd. In this case, everyone was so loud that that it didn't matter where the microphone was. :)
<BR>
<BR>
It was an honor to share the stage with Sally Jaye, Kyler England, LOONER and Jay Nash.<br>
A special thanks to all the guys in my band:<br>

Matt Delvecchio - bass, vocals
Mike Forrester - drums
Mike Freas - guitar
The Mighty Chet Dixon - harmonica, vocals
Curtis Byrd - drums<br>

<p>The <a href="http://www.stelmovillage.org/" target="_top">St. Elmos Village</a> / OG3 Records / Simply Songwriting Music Award. A show, a paperweight, and a cash prize. It was a great success, I felt really good about my set and the place was sort of magic. It was really warm,  not just the sunshine but the people. Everyone should know about this place, it's a center for creativity and positivity and they gave me this honor. </p>




<p>The whole weekend was a hit, from the 2 sets at the Lighthouse in Hermosa Beach to Sunday morning in San Diego and the afternoon in Los Angeles. The cds are selling. I love it. The guys in the band are so cool, we're just having a good time and working it out. We have a sweet sound, with Chet on harmonica singing harmonies with Matty D on bass and Mike Freas on guitar. Forrester was on vacation this weekend. Curtis Byrd played drums with us at the Lighthouse. Yeah.<br>

<p><br>
  It was good to be on the road with my friends Zoe and Angel, and their little dog Ruby. We drove probably 5000 miles in 10 days. I sold a surprising amount of t-shirts and had a lot of fun playing solo, especially at this record store on Fayetteville called Sound Warehouse, I just brought my guitar and played on a bar stool in the middle of the store. That's what songwriting is all about, I felt like I was selling apples at a fruit stand. I walked into that place and the first thing he said was 'I have some vodka' so I could tell he was a friendly guy. He mixed me up a stoli and pop and I got to feeling pretty comfortable. A piano would have been way too loud for that little place so the guitar was perfect. Nice and simple. </p>
<p>This is the golf course we got to have our way with because our friend  works there. Arkansas is beautiful. We had it all to ourselves because it was closed that day. We drove around in golf carts drinking beer.</p>

<p>I've got the Permanent Friday Night release scheduled for June 2nd at the Hotel Cafe, and I'll be getting back out on the road again pretty soon. Next weekend I'm in Hermosa Beach, and then San Diego in the morning and Los Angeles in the afternoon... I will be accepting a songwriting award for my song Ordinary. In a few more weeks, I'll be in Toronto, showcasing at the North by Northeast Music Festival.</p>

04.10.05 The Knitting Factory
<p class="style1">It's just a great stage, it reminds me of !st Ave in Minneapolis, the second tier with black steel handrails and very sparse lighting. Mysterious.</p>
<p class="style1">I didn't know we were playing in the main room until just before we started, and it felt great to have such sweet sound. We had space, we had eyes, we had sound. We had a reason.<br>
  The album goes out for printing on Monday, and I've got some amazing musicians on stage with me at my shows now. I started out playing solo at Highland Grounds and now I'm playing my songs with a 6-piece band at the Knitting Factory. I am blessed. <br>
  The Spring tour is booked except for a few dates, I'll be all over the US, mostly the Southeast and the West Coast. Some solo shows, some stripped-down band stuff. We'll just have to wait and see. The right things always happen at the right times.</p>
<p class="style1">This piece of verse is featured in the layout of Permanent Friday Night, which is taken from a poem I wrote to a friend of mine about two years ago. I spent a lot of time with with my good friend Timothy Norris working on the layout for this album, and I had a whole biography I wanted to put on the panel that I'm using for this poem. You know, 'I first had an idea for this album bla bla bla...' but I figured I'd spare y'all the details and get down to what I really mean.</p>
<p>be glad for that precious pain
there is poetry under your skin;

you are aware
of the human tragedy - that we fall
madly through time
towards death
and truth
in the span of 30,000 sunsets
with only love to guide us

  <br>
  All right. This was pretty serious. Background: 2 years ago I became very good friends with Sally and Joel from Paper Sun. I played with them in their band for about a year, and it was an amazing time. We sang some of the tightest 4-part harmonies you'll ever hear.</p>
<p class="style1">Fast forward to present time - we have continued to develop separate projects, and this was our first time on a bill together in some time. Some of my regular band members were out in Austin this past weekend, so I had to scrounge up a line-up sort of last minute and it was entirely dope. Jeramy Gritter on guitar - holy shit. Jazz vibe, great ear, knows exactly what time it is. Adam Marcello - drums, this guy is a legend in the making. The Mighty Chet Dixon - harmonica, backup vocals - the voice of Louisiana. Mike Forrester, percussion (with the sweet touch). Marc Regan, standup bass like a truck full of molasses. I loved this show so much, I am posting the mp3s right here so that everyone can hear how cool it was.</p>
<p class="style1">We played 5 songs in 40 minutes. It was beautiful. There's something about freedom, within music especially, that just gains momentum so unpredictably. I felt that on Sunday, like some big iron pendulum swinging across the bar, across this lobby of a forgotten hotel. I was among my own, these are the people I love. Jeramy said it himself, &quot;this is what happens when we get together.'</p>
<p class="style1">You see that? At 6pm on Sunday, I didn't even know who was playing. At 9pm, we had just finished our set. It was   a gift. </p>

<p class="style1">It was cold and full of taxis and after the show at Opaline we walked down the street to the Avenue A bar and drank too much whiskey the way you do when you know that someone else is driving... and your girl climbs onto your lap in the back of the cab on the way back to the hotel's 19th floor and you think to yourself, this is better than the movies... and then 3am finds you staring at the Queensboro bridge like a big truck outside the window - <br>
and as long as my heart still beats I am alive in these places, where the sun never shines through completely and the shadows look like nothing next to the dark heart of the city.<br>
You can wake up and be at the airport in an hour, waving a cup of coffee at the navy-blue shoes on the tarmac and get off in Oakland next to Laura Dern.</p>
<p class="style1">I sang for the  airport traffic, sang for the sky-caps and Laura Dern who wouldn't look at me but my ride came first so I never saw her face and it was a hot one that  Sunday in March with the taste of a New York latte still in my mouth... and the Hotel Utah, my sister's proud face and my old friends Carl and Chad... My rocker friends from Los Angeles (Janet Robin, Jen Alpert, Saucy Monky) shared the stage with me and it was a home away from home. My  friend Jenni took care of us in her house by the ocean and we felt loved. Two down.</p>
<p class="style1">We drove home in the mini-van, with breakfast bagel sandwiches and award-winning Russian coffee from a guy named Doug with a shop near Golden Gate park. Los Angeles was waiting for us like a spider's web where we drove around in circles dropping off guitars and we got stuck right in the middle, by the time I got home I had just enough time to get to Room 5 for my show with Chris Pierce and Joe Purdy and Gabriel Mann. Three down.</p>
<p class="style1">Two days later, we are out in Santa Monica where we can smell the ocean and it's a beautiful night, a woman buys me a drink before she even hears me play and we sound better than maybe ever... And the song I had written 4 hours before the gig was the best thing we played that night and it occurs to me that I love my Wurlitzer exactly where it is, waiting for me when I get home... and my voice sounds like honey and razor blades and I can't stop singing my own song back to myself before I go to sleep. </p>

<p class="style1">The Viper Room was pretty heavy. Lots of twisting and dancing and artificial smoke. It was as an occasion, to look out at the faces and know the best is yet to come. It rained like it was the end of the world that night, and you still couldn't see through the thick of it.Well done. </p>

<p class="style1">I am booking some great shows for this Spring. The future is bright. </p>
<p class="style1"><hr>
<span class="style1">02.19.05 </span>
<p class="style1">Only a few more weeks and I'll have the album done. I can't even believe it.
</p>
<p class="style1">It has been, no joke, almost 2 years since I started this thing. I can't possibly say how happy it makes me to have this album almost finished.</p>
<p class="style1">Matt Delvecchio has been an amazing help.</p>
<p class="style1">All the other guys in my band - Bart Ryan, Chet Dixon, Mike Forrester, Mike Freas, you guys rock. Stsy tuned for more news as it comes in. Right now, I've got the Viper Room to look forward to and in two more weeks I'll be in New York City!</p>
<p class="style1">talk to you later</p>

        <title>A landscape</title>
        <link>2005/09/a-landscape</link>
        <description><p>Somewhere in this chaos lives good fortune<br />
Perched beside a campfire<br />
Breathing in the stars<br />
Without numbers<br />
I feel these forces move through me<br />
A lover's rage and a lonesome hunger<br />
My true north and my blessings<br />
Contented for now<br />
And the flow of these images<br />
Spirals of patience and love<br />
As I drag my possessions behind me<br />
Scraps of mortar and blood</p>


<p>I build myself a landscape<br />
In the image of your grace<br />
Asleep in the arms of innocence<br />
A dream plays across your face</p>


<p>When the smoke has lifted<br />
And the sun never again forgets to shine<br />
Let us both remember such places<br />
A thoughtful summer not quite wasted<br />
Waiting for the lights to change<br />
For one color to bleed into another<br />
For the fuel to catch the flame<br />
May nothing remain the same<br />
Not quite yesterday<br />
And never tomorrow<br />
This nest of sorrows past<br />
Of heaven misplaced</p>


<p>Asleep in the arms of desire<br />
A dream plays across your face</p>

        <link>2004/09/hunting-bird</link>
        <description><p>thoughts of pale colors<br />
faded with time<br />
secrets written with hope<br />
this sacred routine<br />
shines like a dull penny<br />
and I feel a new gravity<br />
beginning again.<br />
circles collide and it is<br />
not an illusion<br />
only one road<br />
with infinite scope<br />
I exist<br />
to feel the pressure of love<br />
like a hunting bird circles<br />
before the kill<br />
is it now?<br />
said the mule<br />
looking up<br />
at a shadow</p>

        <title>The Arrival</title>
        <link>2004/09/the-arrival</link>
        <description><p>Strong words like big rocks
Leaning against each other this
Garden of giants
You came ashore like an eclipse
And blinded us all. In
The shape of a promise
The wings of a summer day
Spread their feathers across the sky
It was like magic, unpolished
From some ancient place
And it didn't rain
As if the clouds couldn't speak
The illusion of innocence
But the heart knows better
Cold to the touch, yet
Hot like a black stove
In the sun</p>

        <link>2004/04/shifted</link>
        <description><p>The moon broad and tempestuous<br />
lacking shadow<br />
has descended across the evening<br />
and the empty sky<br />
as if I am not alone driving<br />
not turning the wheel<br />
returned from the day like<br />
a candle extinguished.<br />
To search again for life<br />
with the eyes of a poet I will give<br />
weight to this shift in the heavens<br />
even as there is no witness<br />
no curve in the joking of your eyes<br />
I keep no record<br />
of such things. Let us both be free<br />
in the corners of the world<br />
and it will matter little<br />
that the circle is open</p>

        <link>2004/04/i-feel-as-if-i-need-to-mention</link>
        <description><p>I recently started journalling again, in the end of 2010. It feels good to get back to something I love. What is interesting is that as I am sifting through all of my old hard drives, both in order to migrate all of my blog posts to this new site and to finally do my backups into the cloud - as opposed to hard drives that have to be constantly synced and may fail at any moment - I am finding some great stuff. Old pictures that I thought I had lost, poems that I never published, songs and song ideas that never made it through the vetting process but in retrospect were pretty awesome and also some old pages of what were journal entries in the strictest sense. I was speaking directly to myself, with a deep sense of loneliness, regret and most of all pain. It is deeply personal stuff but for the most part harmless so I am posting it now in the hope that whoever reads it (if anyone) can keep an open mind. It is part of my struggle to be the best and most evolved person I know how to be. This period of journaling lasted from December of 2002 to February of 2004 and then just fell off a cliff. I'm not sure why I stopped - I think finally had a web site that I blogged on, and I seem to have picked back up <a href="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/2006/01/blog-entries-from-2005/">in early 2005</a>.</p>

<p>Anyway, there is a lot of craziness in here, the rantings of a chain-smoking, whiskey-drinking insomniac; but also some wisdom scattered about and clearly glimpses of a wounded soul coming to terms with life and what can only be referred to as truly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existentialism">Existential angst</a>.</p>

        <title>I am completely cocooned</title>
        <link>2004/02/i-am-completely-cocooned</link>
        <description><p>Talk to me, I want to say to myself. What is going on in there?
I'm depressed. I don't know why, it doesn't make sense, I should be proud but I'm not. I've lost the fire; I don't know where it went.
I'm plagued with questions - what is best for me?
Why am I so concerned with time?
Have I accepted that I destined to be an introvert?
Am I nurturing my musical gifts correctly?
Why do I have such a nasty problem with insecurity?
Why are my relationships so short-lived?
What am I trying to do?
Am I just starved for love?</p>

<p>I feel like I don't have anything to say. I feel like I can't relate to people. For some reason, I feel like it's my fault for not learning how. At the same time, I am reminded on occasion that I am found to be very sexy by some people. It confounds me. I have very little love of self - which makes me sensitive to the fact that not everyone likes me. What the fuck is that?
I've got a real list of talents - musical, lyrical, physical, programmable…Why is it not enough? Why am I always looking for justification?
I have to start talking. I have got to get through this.
There's really no problem here. Everything is in place. I just have to start toeing it. Focus. This whole young man old man thing is over. I am where and what I am because of destiny. You have gift you must never waste it. I have made the right choices.
I want to get to the point where I don't feel like a failure. I know that sounds childish, but there it is.
Failure.
I fail every day - to impress, to intoxicate, to assimilate to regurgitate. To rejoice. To release.
I am completely cocooned.</p>

        <link>2004/01/empty</link>
        <description><p>Sometimes I'm empty
and I'm waiting for the sound of a friendly voice
sometimes I think I know better
that true passion lives alone
I make motions in the desert
I assemble my defense
like a brittle mountain
as the earth begins to shake</p>

<p>I am at war now
with the cold tyrants of mediocrity
I see that I've fallen
where my instincts led and left me
I am shaking in the desert
I assemble my beliefs
These little soldiers
marching through the heat</p>

<p>My sweetest friend
your heart is always pure
I imagine life through your eyes
and I wish that I could give more
I only have one chance
to build some blessed destiny
with these words of mine
this voice and these dreams</p>

<p>I am unraveled
the walls of my heart are scoured clean
I feel the seasons
raw and hungry for completion
the world is patient
I am frantic in my lust
for a perfect diamond
some piece of god that I can touch</p>

</blockquote>


<p>Again, time is quiet
Motionless. I watch young winter
Clutter the seasons
Cold footsteps
Across this checkered floor
It is not enough to bleed
As it once was
Life is no longer priceless
And the wave of dull destiny
Will be taller than the sky
When it comes.</p>

<p>I have cold stones in my heart
And the color of desire
Is dark against the night
As the lights in Hollywood flicker
Eyes opened and shut
This is the fuel of the city
Burning innocence.
As if tomorrow
Was not paid for with the
Red faces of children
I have dragged my net
Across the deep</p>

<p>As good as love
As I swallow fire
Pray for me
That I may sleep</p>

<p>I have wondered at the gray sky
At the cycles of deceit
And the shattering of mirrors…
Is it enough to taste the salt of the ocean
Like some love poem
From across the world?
Even as my own dreams run slowly
Beneath this printed sunset
They begin to die. This formula
Is not good science. This city has forgotten
Itself. The winter rains
The Mississippi, front porches
The path beyond the self
With fire and plastic
Replacing the mosquitoes.
I opened my veins
Blood is life is progress
And this cluttered slope feels
Like a prison
Like a woman's flesh
A mountain of sugar
A long shortcut</p>

<p>I woke up today and my voice was
Older than my heart
Which carries a new scar
The image of a better place.
Let me see the earth dressed
For the seasons.
Let me see passion
In the spectrum of time
We replace the impossible
With the same wicked fever
That has burned heaven
to the ground.
Tonight I watch angels
Illuminate the sky</p>

        <title>Lord give me strength</title>
        <link>2004/01/lord-give-me-strength</link>
        <description><p>My last entry was April of last year.</p>

<p>It is now January 2004 and I am going to start writing again. Maybe it is merely the inability to write something positive that has kept me from it, I don't know. I just have to start keeping track of my thoughts like I used to.</p>

<p>I know I was not feeling very positive about everything. Not at all. I was disappointing myself, by being disappointed. I wish I could just do everything I want. At points, that would take at least two people, if not more. That's why I have to make decisions.</p>

<p>Ok, pros and cons. Pro: I would see Japan and Australia in the same trip. A ‘Pacific Rim' tour, as she said herself, and fuck did that sound good. Seeing the whole world in one year, in good hotels. Con: I would devastate a very good old friend, as well as few good new friends. Probably take a step backwards in my social arena, by not being around. Entirely and assuredly jeopardize my financial future in the middle to long term as far as having a steady income. Pro: this would be my first real pro gig, for good money as far as it lasts. An entry for the musical resume, with a good chance of landing nice endorsements and sponsorships. I would have to make a few good contacts on a tour like this. Con: the music is not great. Not terrible, but not great. Would NOT be a terribly hip endeavor.
I am scattered. Have been always. I have to quit smoking but I can't, want to be independent but not yet. I still have not found a way to really enjoy social interactions the way I should. My truest joys I still find alone.
Where does it leave me?
Trying to make the best of what could be a great opportunity, but the call of land unexplored is making me crazy. God, this love of guitar has all of a sudden diluted my destiny. I wanted to play with Alex so that I can be a better guitarist. Now, I have to decide between that and seeing the world, traveling, finding myself again. If only we had more than one chance.
I can't decide. I have to, it will be soon, but I am still crazy - Japan, in 5 or 6 weeks. How do you argue against that, food for the soul? Time alone, like I love.
But I made promises, to myself and to others. Finish what you start. Follow your instincts, the first ones. Do it for love.
So what do I love more: the world, or friendship? It's as simple as that. Everything else would fall into place, either way.
I did the math, and the chances of me making more or less the same are high, with a decent chance of actually making and keeping more money than I do now, until the end of the year. That's a long time. It could really be a different world by then, in ways I don't know.
But here's a con: I might really be on to something, with what I'm doing right now. Playing heavy rock guitar in a cool band, following the dream as I know it in one form; in my hometown, which could only be good thing for my own personal pursuits.
Oh but I love to be on the road. Even for a shit ass country band.</p>

<p>Lord give me strength.</p>

        <title>Simplicity</title>
        <link>2003/12/simplicity</link>
        <description><p>As I pass through this ritual<br />
the solemn jest of circumstance<br />
what lies beneath the scattered chorus<br />
of beautiful lies is only<br />
simple. As if this grand blaspheme<br />
echoes with vast precision<br />
as a caricature of the unknown<br />
in the veins of all creatures<br />
blind to the engine of desire</p>


<p>The solitude does not resist<br />
it summons age with boundless gravity<br />
these foreign lifetimes on a hidden shelf<br />
aligned with sharp intuition<br />
and the softest touch of<br />
simplicity. The radius<br />
of joined hands across the future<br />
imagined like a day in December<br />
imagines the hot summer moon</p>


<p>I wait with this painful thirst<br />
spilling my own secrets among the threads<br />
of wisdom. With heat from this friction<br />
from this collision of dead stars<br />
to guide my drugged senses this is no<br />
simple sacrifice. I belong to these fragments<br />
of a martyr and his cause<br />
a symphony in passing cars<br />
survival and the art of breathing</p>

        <title>Wanting More, Having Less</title>
        <link>2003/12/wanting-more-having-less</link>
        <description><p>It's so seldom that I can put words together
to describe this process of wanting more
and having less. If I knew
where I was going I would not
have so little fear I imagine
days etched on frosted glass
and soft wool on flesh
cedar branches in the Fall
gravel roads and starless nights
in the city
why gravity pulls me in is
not for me to know - this force
of implosion
I see only the spinning of the sky
and your words
like fishes in the sea
eyes that tremble
I would sit with you
as the sun melted in its own heat
and lay out the machinery on its
rusted legs
this engine of time in fragments
laid out on blankets
not for sale
free for the asking</p>

<p>Take this world from me
I have no need of it
it is broken anyway</p>

NOTE: Rachel is still a friend of mine, but we are not really in touch at all. For a brief period from 2003-2004, we wrote poems to each other as a sort of literary love affair. Nothing ever became physical which is just as well. Many of the poems that I wrote in that period were spawned in the creative energy that was flowing during that time.

<p>Rachel
Your name stops time dead
In it's tracks I know what it's like to be
Alone with human frailty
October like a bruise on your chin
I summon the specter of poetry
The phoenix
Burning
Born with an arrow in its wings
This is the path
And you have not risen
Yet. All is torn
From conflict and happiness
Hurts, it makes no pattern
You give life to the rain
So it might come back with
Answers attached
Waiting for love
As if you didn't know where to look.</p>

<p>We stumble through the future
Some of us with magic
In our fingertips
Some with bitter dust
On cracked lips
Everywhere this motion
Blind speed
Rinse
Repeat
Rinse
Repeat</p>

        <description><p>I have wanted so much<br />
from today. To see changes<br />
from a distance,<br />
not like this<br />
with my own flesh<br />
beside the furnace.<br />
And what<br />
of the paths we dig<br />
in the earth, sinking<br />
every day<br />
to our knees with habit<br />
carved into our faces?<br />
We were born to love<br />
to cry<br />
but not to hold our breath<br />
in the dark embrace<br />
of circumstance</p>


<p>today we make the promises<br />
tomorrow we keep them</p>

I spent too much on me<br />
Last night<br />
I felt your body breathe<br />
Your heart<br />
Burning next to me</p>


<p>So<br />
Here we are again<br />
Fireflies<br />
Lighting up the fence<br />
You spin<br />
Further into me<br />
We're at the end</p>


<p>I've waited here for someone<br />
Who peels herself an onion<br />
With the hand of patience<br />
If I stand in your favor<br />
It's a gift I'll open later<br />
Like a flame burning backwards</p>

        <link>2003/09/mental-boxes</link>
        <description><p>it occurs to me in hesitation
that the circle spins forever
something about an exit seems so
unbroken so deep so explosive
and we are only at the window
cheeks pressed against the glass
in wait for this freedom so
pale so tired so unsatisfying
when everything seems empty
and the mirror draws blood
I am lost in these mental boxes
the labyrinth of dull desire
and I am with you on this gentle slope
the slow motion of small disaster
this is only a physical distance
remember that we smile at the same sun
there is no peace here that I did not
raise from chaos I imagine
it is the same for you</p>

        <description><p>What do I see now?<br />
You've hidden your freedom<br />
Beneath your desire<br />
The known, the unknown<br />
You have opened up this river<br />
Flowing between love and fear<br />
The answer is that you are blessed<br />
And no one knows better than you<br />
How to build heaven<br />
Do not insult the world<br />
with apologies - the beauty of your<br />
heart never sleeps. Trust<br />
that your voice carries strength<br />
that your decisions are right<br />
because you made them. You<br />
will be loved<br />
as you are now<br />
as you were then<br />
because destiny makes no mistake<br />
you cannot hide from yourself<br />
any more than you can run away<br />
be glad for that precious pain<br />
there is poetry under your skin;<br />
you are aware<br />
of the human tragedy - that we fall<br />
madly through time<br />
towards death<br />
and truth<br />
in the span of 30,000 sunsets<br />
with only love to guide us</p>


<p>how sad<br />
and exquisite</p>

        <title>Blue</title>
        <link>2003/09/blue</link>
        <description><p>How do I create myself every day?<br />
Without shadow and eclipse<br />
In small motions, followed<br />
Through these cracks<br />
As the foundations grow weak<br />
Like tired children<br />
Blue is the color of hope<br />
Washing her blue hair<br />
In blue water</p>


<p>If you are lost then follow choice<br />
Through the forest of change<br />
No longer afraid of understanding<br />
Yourself. Of all gifts<br />
You are life, splendid and frail<br />
Dressed in the friendship of strangers<br />
Without the burden of time<br />
Alone by the river<br />
Of blue water</p>

        <title>What if I am invincible</title>
        <link>2003/04/what-if-i-am-invincible</link>
        <description><p>What if I am invincible… These are questions for the oracle. I am still so new to myself, I don't yet understand, yet I am so close to it. I have become larger than I know. I have outstepped my own shadow and it is some astral projection, I have stars in my fingers and love in my breath and wisdom in my voice. It matters not that I have waited what could be considered a long time. I have arrived, again for the last time before I am awake, incensed and invincible.
Where I draw my energy from is what I suppose to be the same, cobblestone streets and legs with muscles. Coffee and traffic. Love and treason. The changing of seasons. The magic of a woman who traces runes on my shoulder.
And I believe now that it is sudden and visible, like a new color to the sky. I see faces that look at me differently, I am a master. I deserve to be studied. I am exactly what I should be, unafraid and disastrous, honest and direct. Impatient. I see so clearly now, I am everywhere I need to be and I understand the future in some hidden way, some music not meant for my conscious ears. I believe and I follow and I do not need to see the way, it is before me like the attraction of gravity, of warmth on a cold night.
I have outlined my own blueprint so that it is facile, it is in vivid, immediate memory. I run these races blindly with ulterior intentions and the outcome is the same, I am above.
I bring.</p>

<p>I bring what you are missing, what is nowhere else and what is mine. The essence of free thought and artistic will. The message of my blood and childhood. The beauty of my own existence.
And I am your friend, whoever you are. I respond to questions and I absorb the answers, I study what is foreign to me so that it is understood - and that is why I ask so little. I have brought my own advice. I stand in my own mentorship.
Because I have not found what I wanted in any other place but myself. I shine as my own star, as my own true north and I am grateful. I was not unwise. I am at the foot of a mountain of gifts - and they will all be accepted. I will receive and nurture all arts within my being.</p>

        <title>I haven't written in a while</title>
        <link>2003/04/i-havent-written-in-a-while</link>
        <description><p>I haven't written in a while.</p>

<p>I am thinking about eloquence, about the language that grew from Rilke at the letter writing table, who was my age in his first one. Only 100 years or so, and the very act of thinking has abbreviated itself. I see him as a sort of aristocrat, but I think this a misjudgment. Artists in those days were caught between society and poverty - with little to show for their efforts. I know not how he made his travels but I feel in my heart that he was not affluent at all.
And of course, the language between Van Gogh and Gauguin, in that long French script, with such literal discussion of physical form…
I have passed this legacy of Rilke on to a few now, and I believe that the world will benefit. I just want someone at some point to understand how much I have given to this, in such painless sacrifice - to the music, to the strings on a guitar, to the words on a page. It is no secret, anymore, to me - that solitude and the scrutiny of emotion are at the center of artistic focus… Rilke understood this, and led me also to understand. That one has only to look inward, at the sky within.
Awaken the sleeping voices, the opinions of ghosts and the noises of motion. The colors of metaphor, the magic of tension, the animals of the mind… I am now my own friend and muse, I direct my own consciousness and I heed inspiration above all else. I love my own voice, written and spoken in lustrous syllables. I elevate. I bring.
I am trying to lead now and this is new for me.
I give gifts, I am honorable. I shed light on what I can. I am open and honest, and for this I have recently finished being doubtful. There is far too little time to be what I am not… I have often decided on small adjustments and made them stick but for the most part I carry the same colors, the same patterns and the same stripes. I am utterly who I am and nothing besides that and I am grateful now for that identity… For as long as I can remember, I have been on the inside with myself, I have sensed my own desires and passions and commitments - my own rhythms of being and I have not faltered. God bless me, I have never lied to myself. About relationships and friendships and I have always held myself accountable to mercy, glory and defeat. You cannot take away from me that which guides me, it is a valley below me and a red-eyed sunset, the smoke from distant fires and a current from the ocean… It is the words that bring themselves to life like paper dolls on fire and become ashes before they take their first step…
It is love, love of my friends and my songs and their own cohabitation. I am in the hand of destiny who will write my name across the world in soft blue letters like the sky on paper. My songs will be heard by the coast, by the waves and the cars passing through in the California afternoon.
I will not lose my hope or my grip. These are the days of calculated mischief.</p>

        <title>I promise myself to keep track of everything</title>
        <link>2003/03/i-promise-myself-to-keep-track-of-everything</link>
        <description><p>I promise myself to keep track of everything…</p>

<p>I met Jen on Thursday. Just before our show at O'Briens, Nicole Eadington sends me an email and tells me she wants me to meet her roommate. It was Misty's going away party- who looked amazing, as usual, and I vaguely remember her bending over to show me some cleavage and bending over in the other direction to show me her ass. Body language is so telling but I don't always read it… it's almost better that way, everything makes sense later.
Anyway, we sat and talked together the whole time… I went through two drinks, riveted by our own conversation. We talked about Europe, and art, her growing up in southern California, college (?) semester in Europe (Paris), private high school starts with an F…
That's it.
Tuesday, I call her, hey I called you at work on Saturday but you must have closed early because it was raining…
Nicole sends me another email, so are you taking Jen out on Thursday?
I call, she says says yes, I pick her up, we go to the liquid kitty.
Two drinks each - two kettle tonics for her, one rosebud cocktail and a magical Christian for me…
We talk about Europe, and art, and the war, it's just not the same anymore…
So hey, you wanna go see the ocean?
We're parking, no not the pier because it's completely sketchy…
We'll keep walking - except she has the wrong shoes - why not sit right here?</p>

<p>Neither of us have done this in a while, been so close to the moon and the ocean at the same time, quiet Santa Monica and the sound of waves…
We keep talking, and I lean in, ever so slightly.</p>

<p>It was very slight.</p>

<p>I immediately feel her face, next to mine, turning towards me, her hands come up and we are kissing, ferociously, and I'm proud I didn't smoke that day…
This continues, and I start squeezing her legs, the way I like to do, and she presses towards me, and there are very quiet noises, but I hear them… I start unzipping her pants, what Are you doing? And I say I don't know, until I find her clit with my fingers (silk front of her panties and she's completely smooth) at which point I say - thaaats what I'm looking for and she's moaning, and I reach around her ass with my other hand and can lift her, just a little, around my finger which doesn't go in but keeps knocking.
I think she came, in any case she said thank you (although that might have been for zipping her up) and she said that was just like high school and I think she meant it in a good way…
We kissed in the car for almost too long before she got out but that was after she invited me over the next night, because Nicole wasn't going to be there and that's why…
I just trimmed my pubic hairs gleefully in the mirror for the first time, I am 28 years old. Let me tell you the story.</p>

<p>3/21/03 8:28:22 PM</p>

<p>I'm getting dressed…
It takes me longer and longer… there's never anything left.
Show tonight… I came home this afternoon, and worked on the Early Ride to Vegas song. I love that I can do that - there was not much going on today.</p>

<p>And that whole craigslist ad was very successful… I only wish I tried it next week instead, but we'll see what the turnout is. It might even be better that I unleashed it a week early - I can always repost. It's nice to have new names on the list, and it makes for more hits on my website, at very least. I had fun answering all of the emails today… It's amazing, I was just thinking about how I used to fool around with Nicole donahough in Madison after bartime, and how we had to either meet up at the Plaza right at bar time, or I'd have to try and catch her when she just got home… otherwise there was no way to get in touch. We didn't have cell phones yet… how funny.</p>

<p>Heard a Curtis Mayfield song I could cover someday… track 7.
I could really work my falsetto, someday very soon, when I just altogether pull the plug on this smoking. My birthday is coming up, I should do it then… The world is all mine. I wonder if these solo shows will serve to really build some momentum. It's not entirely impossible…</p>

<p>Here are the songs I'm thinking of doing -</p>

<p>Get This Waiting
Tragic
Centerstone
When they take me in
Waterfall
Brooklyn
Try to listen
Dernier Coup
Won't Fade - but probably not</p>

<p>Maybes (if I can clean them up) -</p>

<p>Early ride to vegas
sometime</p>

        <link>2003/02/i-write</link>
        <description><p>I write.</p>

<p>Something leads me where there are always surprises.</p>

<p>Last night I felt the earth move at 4am and I was writing. Even Los Angeles is lonely in the morning and it felt good, like exploring the unknown. I awake to find myself not very far from beauty, and I am proud. Joseph Arthur, no better than me. My songs are becoming small miracles.
And tonight, by the stars, I made Stephanie want me. She sang for me. :)
I am here, I have connections, next weekend in Vegas with Jenni. It is my world, in all it's contradiction. I am what I should be. Ryan wants to hear my music now. They are starting to come to me.
And this smoking… this blessed curse.
It is who I was, and who I am walking away from. My blues will follow me wherever I go. This speaking to no one, it is all I can do now. My voice is made, it is what it is. I write.
And I remember Jon talking about my use of metaphor. I appreciate what exists but forget what I create.. it is new, it is poetry. Follows birds across the ocean… I have arrived.
Look at me, with my arms around the world.</p>

        <title>crossroads</title>
        <link>2003/02/crossroads</link>
        <description><p>So maybe this is the crossroads. It does seem that good things like to happen simultaneously, as if to force a difficult decision. That's probably what amounts to resolve, the sense of direction, and fate.
I wish so much to see all things at once, but sadly I realize that I am only to understand what is necessary. My oldest addiction, the playing of music, makes itself known in many ways and I have learned nothing except that I want - or rather that I have - no control.
I will always be running back and forth, chasing paths that conflict in small ways, and I would give so much to have a glimpse at what I am building.
I understand that I am to be alone until something changes, until I feel like I can share all parts of myself. I fear to some degree that I would be judged, for my bad habits as well as my good ones, and I have yet to come to a conclusion about myself, as to what parts are worth defending… the obvious answer is that I should be proud of all that I am, which is for the most part true but there is always the feeling that I am less and have achieved less than what my fortune deserves. And that is at the root of it, this feeling that all that I have and all that I will be is somehow to be less than what my mind fashions. And from this I draw the anguish, the bitterness, and the wisdom that I am so small with such enormous designs. This is the starting point, and I will spread my wings as best I can.
Of all the truths that surround me, I choose to believe that I am great… that I have wandered through darkness very quickly, and my intuition serves me well.
I am thankful for the equation, for the balance of faith that belongs to me. I feel my own beauty like warm skin on these bones; a face that smiles back at me and will always have pride. I am a living potion, in equal parts red flame and white snow. My fathers before me stand tall, and my blood is alive with magic of the earth. I shape myself in the image of my ambition and I know that I am right to be obsessed. It is what is needed.</p>

        <title>messengers</title>
        <link>2003/02/messengers</link>
        <description><p>I write with obscene distractions<br />
Collapsing myth and desire<br />
Into fiction. This false mirror<br />
The distance effect<br />
Bring me to the center<br />
Of careless reflection<br />
I am caged within myself<br />
Eager to touch the outside<br />
To re-imagine this contest<br />
Of machines in some new circle<br />
The human satellites<br />
The race of love against momentum<br />
My own skin warm from the memory<br />
Of union. Let no one seek<br />
To cover this unborn flower<br />
Cradled in the soft earth<br />
I dream this without madness<br />
Leaned against the echoing wall<br />
Where a whisper is united<br />
With power and substance<br />
Kings of modern freedom<br />
These messengers shall be</p>

        <title>Whisper</title>
        <link>2003/02/whisper</link>
        <description><p>Somewhere there is a voice that<br />
Tires quickly, and retreats.<br />
Leaps quietly over<br />
Ambushes and dead-end streets, so </p>


<p>Drawn to the distant that none can approach<br />
This voice. So fearlessly building<br />
A new world from nothing,<br />
This whisper of a song.</p>


<p>And these cycles reinvent themselves,<br />
Like children lying to each other…<br />
Maybe I imagined this voice<br />
That cannot speak.</p>


<p>I love that you are from Brooklyn, I<br />
Would say to her. I had already found<br />
Poetry in you, like<br />
A current of gold</p>

        <title>And everyone is just doing their thing</title>
        <link>2003/01/and-everyone-is-just-doing-their-thing</link>
        <description><p>Tuesday, January 07, 2003
12:29:39 AM</p>

<p>And everyone is just doing their thing…</p>

<p>I'm thinking of Chad, my old friend/enemy who moved to San Francisco and took his rock chick with him… I think of seeing Courtney, all decked out in ultra-modern trashy punk chic who I saw looking at fruit in Ralph's right off of Formosa with Vanessa on my arm; and look at us now. All separated, and shit.
I wonder if Korena will respond. If I had to put money on it - well, I won't say. I don't want to jinx it.
And I forget sometimes - it seems more often than not - but I still have it, I have this passion and this intensity… It's right at the point where I don't really give a shit anymore, that everything becomes easy again. I am living in a circle.
So tonight, I celebrated my own rediscovery. Another spin around the sun. French martinis - Frenchtinis - and a hell of a cheeseburger. With a salad afterwards -
because I don't want to lose sight. It's right when you get close that you lose hope. I could be right around the corner from another shift in the right direction.
I cannot hesitate any longer. I decide, I move, I reassess. My instincts have developed, I can fully trust myself… To really have the ability, I can be a guitar player - because I want to. It's all just a question of time.
I am moving in the right direction reasonably fast. This year, I think, will mean a lot. The world will finally know what I've been up to.</p>

<p>Love</p>

        <title>New Day</title>
        <link>2003/01/new-day</link>
        <description><p>I can't concentrate<br />
When the day yawns<br />
and through this glass door<br />
I see the outside<br />
A haze over the canyon<br />
A wet mask held in place<br />
These are just glimpses<br />
Some other system of faith<br />
Help me remember the way<br />
That I saw this cold rain<br />
As falling jewels<br />
Littering the sky<br />
And in my troubled sleep<br />
I am a witness to the morning<br />
Bright fingers around the earth<br />
The science of summer<br />
Alone in the mind's eye<br />
Balanced on crutches of fire<br />
It feeds me this bitter rum<br />
Poured over my pale body<br />
Like silver ghosts<br />
The proud new day<br />
Born without knowledge<br />
Of love or misery</p>

        <title>I am awake</title>
        <link>2002/12/i-am-awake</link>
        <description><p>12/11/02 2:48:55 AM</p>

<p>I am awake. It is at any time that I may smile and forget. I am reminded of myself, the same map I still follow, and I wonder at the confusion I see around me. I have been so lucky, or wise somehow. Something that leads me knows many things. I have understood my surroundings, my tools, I have discovered myself. I write as I breathe, as I assemble small things together. Were these gifts, or victories? Why is it that I have such wealth of identity? I look at my life stretching out before me and I am unafraid. My decisions until now have been pure intuitions. Am I indeed en route to the musical utopia that I crave, or am I to serve some other peripheral cause? I have only the trust within, the casual blindness that I use to move quickly. I can only see what I choose - the steps that climb, the voices that sing and the depth of my hallucinations. The folds of beauty that fall from my fingers, which are learned habits that have disguised themselves as improvisational power.
So is this the scheme, the routes my muscles have traveled and the roads they have built? Do others find some shortcut of manufacturing, some assembly line that spits out blood? I am at times adorned with praise, but still I am no closer to this elevation. Maybe I am right to believe that true transcendence happens too quickly to notice. The edge of a precipice may seem all too level... I await this newness.
And this is how it happens, I am sure of it. I am every day closer to myself. I have torn down all the barriers to my own realization; there is nothing that stands before my own ritual and me.
So I build this thing - with care and wisdom, as I would have it. With the often supported truth that there is no way to share this vision. All that can be respected in this impatient world is the verdict, as faith has been supplanted by priority. All things must fall now between initiatives, as if good must be grown instead of nourished. As if beauty needs to be seen in order to be recognized.
And I don't believe that, in my heart. I am still clutching the fact that beauty IS. It does not mock itself for spectators, and it does not serve anything. Why should I direct my own impulses towards some ethereal target? Value is often assigned in retrospect, and all that I have now is preference. I prefer to follow my own leaders.</p>

<p>I prefer to believe in myself, not because I should but because I was born to.</p>

<p>This will be a triumph.</p>

        <title>I'm the guy who doesn't know when to stop</title>
        <link>2002/12/im-the-guy-who-doesnt-know-when-to-stop</link>
        <description><p>Monday, December 09, 2002
01:13:04 AM</p>

<p>I'm the guy who doesn't know when to stop, or how to remove myself from the subject. I am always in character. It's all personal. Or I am looking past it, or to the side... My moments are genuine, and I respect the art of casual conversation, but I'm always looking for clues that hint to something bigger. Oh, so you're excited about THIS, what does that mean - why does that matter? Why am I listening? Which misses the point... I am a part of something, maybe just a moment between two people - and things progress naturally, that's a fact. But for some reason, I want to see a promise; I want flame, and madness. Or else I will improvise conceptually, I will wrap my own silence around the setting like an army of candles and peer across exaggerated distances. I will leave the room and come back, watching in slow motion as the exchanges of energy become fireworks... And not contribute a word. It is a tax I enforce. And just before it becomes obvious that I have been silent for some spell, I mention something trivial, as if my mind had been somewhere else... When, in fact, I have just been intensely aware of other-than-self. I have been in awe of the magic between humans.
And I see perhaps the alternate facts... The may-have-beens, the sad longings, and the silent understandings. The emotional contracts, and the web of possibles. So I surprise myself, and mesmerized by my own lack of impulse I form opinions, lingering forever in the middle. Somehow I admire the carriers of interest, the lines of thought through chaos that charge ahead with will, but I often see my peers, my friends, stumbling over the same things, as if they were in some mental darkness. It seems obvious to me that the path I seek has not yet been found, and that all comparison should defer to the future. I can only learn what not to do.
It occurs to me that my original tenets still hold true, most importantly the one that says 'true talent will always find it's way'; if I continue to distinguish myself from others, and build on the foundations that I have assembled there will never be a question of whether or not I was talkative enough. That seems absurd. I will always hold that one can only be so wise as to know oneself, and that is sufficient. Why would we seek to change our impulses without first knowing what they are? And that task itself needs a lifetime. I have been plagued and weakened by some doubt about my own personality, the energy I should offer so willingly to all that wish to see but it does not come naturally to me to be so consistent. I guess that's acting - feigned consistency. When I decide to act, I want it to be in a Hollywood class for beginners, not at a social audition. I still want honesty. I want to be recognized, not trivialized. I don't know what that means...
Except that I'm surprised how everyone finds a way to fit - even though most of it is for show. Even though so much discord lies just beneath the surface, like cockroaches, I still am amazed at how most of it is so pretty, this enormous pretension. We all live our lives with so little, such a limited view, such a narrow approach; and pleasure is so fleeting - hunger so complete, so consuming. Luck is a bad friend. Love doesn't always stay.
And then I am lost in a crowd of intentions.</p>

<p>And then I grow tired.</p>

        <title>This is my first time</title>
        <link>2002/12/this-is-my-first-time</link>
        <description><p>Wednesday, December 04, 2002</p>

<p>This is my first time.</p>

<p>It's like coming back after a long journey.</p>

<p>I am committed to bringing back the prose in my life. I remember having thought many times before, god, if only I could make the time to get used to writing a lot, often. There's so much I would say... I feel like I've had so much free time that gets wasted. I may be one of the most productive individuals in this universe, but of course by my own standards, there is so much left to accomplish. Maybe it's just the reformed slackers that later in life become so awkwardly motivated. It's like I'm still learning to walk.
But it does occur to me that so much in life that is reproachable stems from apathy, from inaction. I don't ever want to feel party to that. So maybe that's all that is important - caring. About anything... maybe this is just passion I feel, straight up like a shot of whiskey. Everything, in the end, has to do with whiskey.
I have known for some time now, that I have an addictive mind. I remember having said that if one is good, two is better... and so on. Of course I was talking about women - not necessarily group sex, I think it was in reference to giving gifts; but the premise is the same. I feel that, deep in my bones - the need to multiply what I love.
And now I am empowered. I have the tools, this new computer, and the world stretches out now like a long road waiting to be traveled. The people I see, the grails I chase and the bullets shooting past me are all short stories developing themselves. Every voice I've ever heard, and every decision I didn't make fast enough are now available for revisiting, for extension. I can imagine things I never did, and put words in anyone's mouth. I can give all of my pain justification.
Why is it that I only want to document the most cerebral chapter in the history of humanity that has somehow found itself fallen into a blonde cliche? Even as the majority of world citizens struggle with destiny itself, or at best let go completely of the sciences that have built their world, the sharp edge of innovation refines the human sphere to oligarchic orgasm. Am I not to stand in awe, pen ready? I wish to understand, to empathize towards the synthesis of a new emotion: awareness, the sterilized cocaine. A luxury.
To what end? As every writer follows a hidden signal... I want some rung in the ladder of human consciousness to be my namesake, nothing less. On this cold night, in the lap of lost memories with a view over the landscapes of destiny - in Los Angeles, on a street still thick with the air of decay my fate begins.</p>

<p>With short steps and long thought have I risen, and the moment approaches to accelerate. I have learned from others only what not to attempt. My ideas remain pure, as the dilution that comes from popularity has not surfaced. I give thanks often for my gifts of music, both given and received. The fruits of my retrospection have been simple affirmations. If destiny is not my friend then surely I am my own benefactor. I was ashamed to admit the extent of my compensation today... Among my own friends, I am often a stranger, of my own retreat. I will return in time.
Because there are no contemporaries for me. I have been dealt some ancient joker, and the value is uncertain but the prospect is good. I have been, for a long time now since a dark evening by the lake in Madison that I remember, rich in self-assurance. It is a warm wind that touches me sometimes and I follow it always. I am alone sometimes because of it, and I am not without my own serpents but the light is always visible. Even at night, when I am visited by doubt. I am not afraid of the silence.
Here is the course of the day, and the moments of exhaustion, and the flames of addiction. The pensive perch, and the mental engine. The gears of logic. The cloud of ennui, and the certainty that comes with a healthy bank account. It's all mine, the knowledge, the magic, the language and science of code that gives me such power. I found it all like a hunter and a thinker, with study and contemplation, and with a fair amount of deceit. I can see now how the past may be reconstructed for the greater good. I will make the world glad for its trust.</p>

<p>thank you</p>

        <title>Slow Motion</title>
        <link>2002/09/slow-motion</link>
        <description><p>Life in slow motion.<br />
I always made mistakes<br />
Forgive me. Truth be told<br />
I have been weak for some time<br />
But you know this. We believed each other<br />
And it was beautiful<br />
Until the weight of my own darkness<br />
Touched your shoulder. Silence<br />
For me is passion<br />
Passion for me is<br />
When you come<br />
I wish a thousand blessings on you<br />
For not hesitating<br />
For bringing me closer<br />
All I have to offer<br />
Are the moments not<br />
Forgotten. I am empty<br />
As I was. Drowning<br />
like a dumb puppy. </p>


<p>I don't know how to be touched</p>


<p>Forgive me.</p>




<blockquote><small>The previous was an apology to a girlfriend who deserved better.

Next is her exceptional reply:</small></blockquote>


<p>Temporary</p>

<p>So he said he runs away even from the good things
Well now, I run full force ahead into them
Knocking them down with my brashness
When they eventually recover from their temporary
concussions
They look at me and say- who are you? and how did
you get here?</p>

<p>I think you will say that eventually
I came at you like a man
But now I want to be a girl
She said you have to stay the same
I can't change
Oh horrid consistency</p>

<p>You are a good thing, I think
But I don't know if I am blinded by your chords
Or that feeling of wanting to covet or possess the
truth you harmonize
Do I just want a piece? Do I just want to be
inspired?
To be in the presence of a force
To know that for a moment when the lights are low
and the flame burns
high
That you are mine-to touch, to breathe in, to hold
Briefly</p>

<p>In a city of the lost and found
I smiled
And you smiled back
For a time I found you
But in the pit of my stomach I have the creeping
sensation of loss
The echo chamber, the tug on the sleeve, the tap on
the shoulder
I can't hit snooze</p>

<p>So I will tell you about myself
I will make the fatal error of maxim exposure
I will smile and bat my eyes and
Hope that you don't make me sorry</p>

        <title>A Letter</title>
        <link>2002/05/a-letter</link>
        <description><p>The art within myself
Not myself within the art
Good advice
When all there is to this game:
Passion and reason
North and south.
You speak so fluidly
Every word like saltwater
rising from the break
The air bristling with it.
And I am enclosed within this
Letter, just a notion of sweet
release, a blessing for you.
Tomorrow looms large
Like a glass tower and I will climb
Those fragile steps without care.
Looking out across rooftops
And clouds of bitter chalk
Drop my senses and watch them
Fall (as if from the heavens).
The essence of my path
Has been chaos, and I would very grimly
Speak of discipline
And sacrifice were it not
for the burden of truth.
If there has ever been
A home for my heartspeak
It is this symbol of infinity
That I cannot see.</p>

<p>Carry me, for one day
Beautiful chaos
Color the sky with a whim
Anywhere there is motion
Is a good place to begin</p>

<p>awwhh, you know
you're making me blush...
no really, I have not gotten lucky in a little too long.
I'm sore from 35 minutes of aerobic kickboxing and a whole lot of
stretching.
Anyway, tonight should be easier.
I'll keep you posted...</p>

<p>the milk story: (I'll try to make this quick)</p>

<p>when I moved back to Paris at the age of 11, I still had a bunch of
friends in NY.
So the first summer I was back - by then I guess I was twelve  - I had a
friend come to visit.
His name was Dennis.
We all went to a town called Cavalier, which is kind of in between Nice
and Monte Carlo in the south of France.
Some family friends had time-shared a beautiful mansion - no joke, like 10
bedrooms - right on some cliffs by the coast.
Very cool.
So it was my then-still-intact family, my friend Dennis, this other
family, and some of their friends.
One night after hanging out all day at our private beach, we all had
dinner together.
Dennis and I had some red wine with dinner - I was only 12, but I could
handle it.
Dennis, on the other hand, couldn't. He was feeling sick.
My sister Katia, who had a nice buzz on, decided that the best thing to do
would be for all of us to learn the words to her favorite Doug E Fresh
song, you know, Ladi Dadi, we like to party - I think that's how it goes -
so we could all sing it together.
Anyway, that worked for a while - but it was getting late, and we were
going to bed, and Dennis was still feeling sick.</p>

<p>So my mother, in her infinite wisdom, decided to warm up some milk, for
him to drink, thinking that would help him sleep.
He took a sip - and you could already tell that it was the worst possible
thing for him to be putting in his body, just by his facial expression -
but my mother didn't see that, she was just smiling at him, waiting for
him to finish it.
So Dennis, being the pushover that he was, just drank the rest of it in
one gulp. My mother was satisfied with that, and kissed us all goodnight.
The minute the door had closed, Dennis went running for the bathroom, and
spent the next ten minutes reliving his dinner experience - with me and my
sister singing Doug E Fresh. Ladi Dadi, we like to party, we don't cause
trouble we don't, bother nobody...</p>

<p>And about a half hour later, we were all asleep, even Dennis. So maybe it
worked, after all.</p>

<p>That's the milk story.</p>

<p>how are you feeling, lush?</p></blockquote>

<p>there once was a girl
who never asked for what she wanted
so she never quite knew
there were good things and bad things
always there were gifts and people who adored her
but nothing ever made her completely happy.
So she said to herself:</p>

<pre><code>Maybe if I can make everyone in the world love me
maybe that will make me happy
to know that no one ever thinks badly of me
</code></pre>

<p>so she tried really hard, to always say the nicest things
and to always listen, and to go wherever she needed to
and always smile at people and to always seem happy, at least</p>

<p>but there were always people she hadn't met
that looked at her, suspiciously
and she was convinced they were thinking bad thoughts about her
and it only made her feel worse
so she said to herself:</p>

<pre><code>Maybe if I keep moving around, I will find the perfect place
and everything will be right
and I will know where it is that I was meant to stay
</code></pre>

<p>so she travelled, and spent lots of money
she saw Rome and Cairo and Bangkok and Rio
and everywhere in between
and she had fun, she stayed busy
but one day, she woke up in a hotel
and felt something was missing
there was an emptiness about her
and she realized that she missed her home
but she didn't know where that was anymore</p>

<p>So she said to herself:</p>

<pre><code>Maybe if I don't listen to anyone
and always do what I want without thinking
and be completely selfish
maybe that will make me happy
</code></pre>

<p>so she never thought about anyone
and always pushed her way to the front of the line
and took the best seats
and double-parked, and never shared with anyone
but she realized she was lonely, and that wasn't working either.</p>

<p>So, she was finally in very much despair
she had tried everything
and still wasn't happy
so she asked her friend emma what to do</p>

<p>and emma said - I know just the thing
you should have sex with my friend krister
he'll cheer you right up</p>

<p>so that's what she did
and she never stopped smiling</p>

<p>:)</p>

        <link>2000/10/scared-and-unprotected</link>
        <description><p>10/25/00</p>

<p>A lot to say.</p>

<p>Annemarieke argued herself out of a relationship with me. The first weekend, we went to the Pier View with her dog, walked on the beach, saw dolphins. Very nice. I slept over, had unprotected sex, very much not like me. She is a good girl, and should not be any danger. The next weekend, we saw a couple of movies - Meet The Family, she liked that one. Ladies Man, eh, not so bad. At the last show she came to - Viper Room #3 - apparently she didn't like that I left her alone for 10 minutes so I could mingle. Can you say, high maintenance? Sorry babe.
So it all came down to this past Sunday. We got back from Ladies man, I needed to grab some clothes so I could sleep over and make it to work in the morning. Next thing you know, she's asking me to twist one - and then another (this coming from young Miss DARE Amsterdam). She had something to get off of her chest. She asked me directly - what do you do, in a relationship, when you know you won't get what you want? My answer, I knew why she was asking already - was, you move on. Just that simple. So maybe I decided for her.
Anyway, the next day David can't get her out of his house. She cried on her dog pillow, as I was leaving, and apparently wished that I had turned around and knocked. What a wimp. You make strong move, you can't be looking for anyone to hold your hand. I respected her for being so all business. Oh well.
And then there is Emma. She should be a chapter herself. A novel. I guess it boils down to this - anyone who offers their butt so willingly, so confidently - 9 times out of 10 I won't be worried about protection. Which is ridiculous, because that's when you are in such danger. But again, with Emma, I don't know how much she hasn't told me but I have a gut feeling that there is nothing to worry about. She said she always has a boyfriend, and I think the guys she ends up with are probably pretty wholesome types.
Shit, I don't know. That's the end of it. That won't happen again with anyone else. I promise to myself, to god, and anyone who is listening. I cannot jeopardize my future like that. It really is Russian roulette.</p>

<p>So, I guess I have very little to worry about. Which is good, because that is still enough to keep me a little stressed, give me that edge. I think at one point, you have to trust your instincts, and your lack of them, and as well trust your mistakes. I stand by these last two weeks, and I hope deeply that I won't live to regret them at all because they have been very dear to me. I have, all at once, all the tools I have been looking for - income, relationships, a good gig, inspiration, personal freedom. Now I need to bend the road in front of me, paint myself a doorway out. These are my strengths.
I have so much to do, and I am happy to say that I am completely on track. 26 years old, finally making a decent income, a car on the way, debts receding, social and inter-sexual skills improving, confidence returning. I am no longer afraid to admit that I deserve all of this, I have brought love into the world and I have made unselfish sacrifices. I am a good person, the universe loves me and I love it right back.
My musical tastes are rounding another corner, I guess thanks to Revolver I am embracing the Brit Pop movement. Radiohead, Travis, Coldplay - I feel these now. Another notch.</p>

<p>Emma girl, Emma girl</p>

<p>I am safe with you
I am not broken
I will live as long as I wish
I have so far to go
I have barely begun</p>

<p>And that is why I am absolutely content. I love where I am, what I am doing. I am looking forward to seeing my friends in Madison, and seeing my friends in Chicago.</p>

<p>Amen</p>

<p>what do I say to all that? Aside from, you have a way with words. I can
tell
you and I are going to get along famously! Even if we don't have that
badda
bing badda bang that some people have... at least I know I am comfortable
enough to make a new friend in this crazy town... I am not worried about
the
three week thing...actually it's a subconscious effort... I can't help it,
it just happens that way. But, it's not important is it?! Not really...</p>

<ul>
<li>I just proof-read this next paragraph, and realize that my grammar
sucks,
my sentences are really long, and you can forget about good sentence
structure. So, rather than fix it... I decided to say fuck it, forgive the
butchering of the english language... read on!!
What do I like to do for fun? Hmmm... I love work... workaholic I
suppose!
But, for fun, I go out with my friends... dinner-mostly sushi in Hermosa
Beach, because that's where all those silly girls live!, drinks in
hermosa,
hollywood, westwood, brentwood... you name it! If it's fun, you can pretty
much bet we'll do it. I am not a real TV person, so I don't spend a ton of
time in front of one, but when I do watch, I am almost catatonic... it
sucks
me in! not that I enjoy it all that much! Um...I completely enjoy some
alone
time now and then. I like grabbing a good book, a pad of paper, my
favorite
pen of the week (I have a pen thing, if I find one I love, I won't let go
of
it! Sick, eh?!), my smokes and reading glasses and going to a coffee shop
to
just sit and ponder life, people, and what-not. My idea of a great day is
waking up to coffee and a smoke, showering, sitting around in my robe for
a
bit, then getting dressed going somewhere public and writing, then going
home having sex with George Cloony (just kidding!), taking another shower,
and going out with my friends for some drunk pleasurable partying (ie.
dancing and drinking). I have this thing about dancing though, I have to
be
drunk enough to get into it... and when I do it, it's with wreckless
abandon. So, that's me... I like reading, writing, talking, watching,
driving, drinking an orgasmic glass of wine, kissing, and looking up at
the
stars to make a wish everynight. What do I wish for? Depends on the
night...
mostly it's that everything will work out in my life... but I don't really
have to wish for that, even though it makes me feel better when I do.</li>
</ul>


<p>I love to travel, but I also realize that I can tell you all about this
stuff in person... it's good to save some things for later.</p>

<p>As for whatever it is you look like... you said to picture you as a young
child... well, that's a bit of a turn off...sorry to say! I just can't
seem
to get into the whole idea... I have a little brother so it's kinda making
me sick. So, here's the deal, I am sending you a picture of me from
August... I was in Hawaii, drinking a mai-tai and having a great time with
the family... you can tell by the look on my face. Call me crazy for
actually sending you a picture, but I figure it's a better way to know who
the hell you are telling your childhood stories to.</p>

<p>I'm leaving in about 45 minutes, please write back... or write my hotmail
account if it's later.... I want to hear what you have to say to all this
hooplah! And, please don't tell me I make you sick... that would really be
a
blow to my ego.</p>

<p>I guess I should explain a little...
at the risk of going a little too far in depth, picture me as a young
child...
I am the youngest of three, two older sisters.
My father is seventeen years older than my mother. Before I moved back to
Paris in 1985, we lived in White Plains, a relatively affluent suburb of
New
York City, in Westchester county. It wasn't quite Rochester, or New
Rochelle
- that was upper class - but we were like upper middle class... I guess
the
difference is, expensive domestics - Cadillacs - as opposed to BMWs, or
something.
In any case, we had a beautiful, enormous house. In 1982, for example, I
was
8 years old, and my mother was still in her 30s. I went to school just a
few
blocks away. Sometimes my mother would walk me to school. Other times, she
would pick me up for lunch. Those were good days. At the age of 37, my
mother was still completely stunning. I was finally thinning out a little,
but I was this chubby little dude with a whole mess of curly hair and a
big
smile. We drove a nice Volvo, lived in this great house, I was put into
this
advanced program in school - life was better than great. That, initially,
is
what life was to me. Everyone was beautiful, there were no problems with</p>

<h2>money or otherwise, living was just like marching in a parade or something</h2>

<p>I knew where I was going...
And then, we moved to Paris - the second time. Next thing you know, I'm
smoking hashish and cigarettes, drinking Johnny Walker - I got quite a
jumpstart - I started writing music on the piano. I was growing up.
And then, all of a sudden - my sisters both graduated, my parents
divorced,
I spent 6 months with my mother in Paris and then got shipped back to NY
to
finish High School.</p>

<p>I think it was around this time that started asking myself, what the hell
just happened? Where did all the beauty go?</p>

<p>And now, as an adult, I get the chance to see my mother once in a great
while. The last time she came to visit, this past September, we got to
talk
a lot. That may have been the first real peer-to-peer dialogue that we
have
ever had.
I'm trying to remember exactly who she was referring to... It may have
been
the guy that came to deliver the couch that she helped me buy from Ikea.
But she said, really casually - "not very attractive, is he?" - with a
little curl of the lips. Like he was doing her a disservice, or he was
directly insulting her with his looks.
And I felt this whole wave of resentment towards her. I still don't really
understand it.
I think I felt like it was a revelation, like all of a sudden I realized
that my mother was biased against ugly people.
But I am too - when I see someone who I find strikingly unattractive, I am
actually fascinated. And who am I to make judgements about the way some
people perceive and react to other people? Making judements about people
who
are judgemental is like the pot calling the kettle black. It doesn't make
any sense.</p>

<p>I don't even know why I'm telling you this, except to explain that if I am
touchy about being 'aesthetically judgemental', it's because I still don't
know why that little comment of my mother's bothered me so much. But I am
guilty also - it's human nature.
It's Darwinism, for crying out loud...
And I think it's a little bit of guilt, because all of my life I've known
that I'm pretty easy on the eyes. But if anything, physical beauty is a
curse, because it tricks you into believing it's actually worth something
by
itself - which it isn't...</p>

<p>Wow, I just got pretty deep.</p>

<p>Not bad for an explanation, though, eh?</p>

<p>And as for your three week test phase, I imagine the key is to not worry
about it (for me at least).</p>

<p>I totally agree, if it's not fun, it's not worth it.
So let's just have fun.</p>

<p>What do you like to do, aside from writing long emails? (which I'm getting
pretty good at, also)</p>

        <title>don't call me anymore</title>
        <link>2000/08/dont-call-me-anymore</link>
        <description><p>Whatever</p>

<p>Maybe I should write another poem
Maybe I should drink some more poison
Maybe there's no difference between love and
frustration</p>

<p>Maybe I haven't wasted anything
It seems so sudden, this shift
This earthquake. But the sky was dark for months</p>

<p>And where do I find peace, now?
Which way to something better, forgiveness
I hate myself for being your victim</p>

<p>I still fantasize about your body but
Now I have nightmares about your friendship
About the words you never could say</p>

<p>If you love me, you still don't know why
And it doesn't make you happy
So why should it matter?</p>

<p>If I told you how many times I've said
To myself: "You aren't going to call her ever again,
unless..."
You wouldn't believe it</p>

<p>Unless this, or that - if you'd call by Friday
If you fucked me well, blew me whatever
Unless nothing is the logical end</p>

<p>I feel no more pain, I should thank you
For that but I won't
I've been numb for a month now</p>

<p>If I could have it all again
All the time I should have spent
Instead of wasting it on love</p>

<p>like I didn't have enough</p>

<p>I knew in San Francisco, you took your dog
And left me on the phone with Reception
"I will be alone tonight, in fact..."</p>

<p>I can't be let down anymore
I can't love you like this, anymore
You chose your path
I am choosing mine
I choose no more disappointment
A dusty road in August
Away from Ohio
Tell your mother you lost a friend
Somewhere in West Hollywood</p>

<p>Goodbye</p>

<p>k</p>

        <title>The Infinite Once</title>
        <link>2000/03/the-infinite-once</link>
        <description><p>Fast friends ex-lovers unite
and be alone together
this is no wasteland, more
sex for all and all for sex
when secrets are not hidden
they need not be kept</p>

<p>I have not fallen, or made
sour any glances no false
words have crept from these lips
(that once embraced
your waist)
the memory of taste</p>

<p>The infinite Once, no more
no less than enough
if taste lingers well
then loss lingers too much;
one finger from a handshake
some fraction of an earthquake</p>

<p>Your taste, half sweet grace
a soft exquisite place
a bullet through flesh
fine feminine mesh. I
cherish the scars, tracing
your cheek among stars</p>

<p>And the sweep of your hip
the parade of senses - arrested
lost in the curve of your lips
losing a battle against them
the average day eclipsed
by the sugar of your skin</p>

<p>The infinite Once, so perfectly
begun. Such force of attraction
between bodies in motion
such gravity
such careless velocity
of casual emotion.</p>

<p>You are a sky among oceans
a belief among notions
such a deep silhouette
and delicious half-poison -
bringing death back to life
bringing dull to explosion</p>

<blockquote><small>written for Lisa</small></blockquote>

        <link>2000/03/raining-in-the-city</link>
        <description><p>The timing of the drops
the circle flashes
all the shadows gone
when lightning passes
I'll be coming home
with nothing in my pockets
but water from a stone
and bullets from a rocket</p>

<p>It's raining on your city
Raining on your city tonight</p>

<p>I see you on the street
before the sunrise
tapping out yor beat
preserving your size
reflections of the rain
sharp and shot with thirty
colors from your name
wet bright and dirty</p>

<p>It's raining on your city
Raining on your city tonight</p>

<p>there's nobody on the streets
no strangers here to meet
and that's all right
Just the river and the curb
and the traffic to disturb me
in the moonlight</p>

        <description><p>Almost midnight and I don't know
where I am or where I should go
City nights like a pale young face
staring out into empty space
What do we do to pass the time
watch TV with a glass of wine
who would want to have to drive
who would want to be sober tonight
There is a flock outside the door
stramgers vying for seats on the curb
Let your words fall like rain comes down
I will listen but I won't drown
speak to me like you say your name
without thinking and and without pain
speak to me like you say your name</p>

<p>Do you love me like fiction stands
without fact and without demands
when the world weighs on your knee
will you still make some room for me
Hollywood just outside yor window
Just one dollar to dream in limbo
Let your words fall like rain comes down
I will listen but I won't drown
speak to me like you say your name
without thinking and and without pain
speak to me like you say your name</p>

        <link>2000/02/younger</link>
        <description><p>Like a fool when I was younger
I would burn to feed my hunger
everything that I stood on
like a spider eats her young
like the doorways just get lower
the traffic just gets slower
like living just gets dirty
like 5 o'clock should be 5:30</p>

<p>in a way I haven't changed
I still answer to my name
I stll put good where there was evil
I still have faith in decent people</p>

<p>The world that we live in
there's a bill going through it
stacks of money changing hands
I could buy myself a chance</p>

<p>Like a fool when I was younger
I put my hand right in the fire
I stood and faced the eyes of love
I knew too little or too much
but like the day I never met you
of all the things I could hold on to
it makes no sense to be alone
if we share the journey home</p>

<p>in a way I haven't changed
if that means I stay the same
like the Europeans say
plus ca change plus c'est la meme chose</p>

<p>The world that we live in
it's a thousand different colors
it's the infinite lover
the mother of mothers
The world that we live in
it's a thousand shades of grey
every word I didn't say
every gift that no one gave</p>

<p>The world that we live in
is bigger than a coffee cup
and it won't get filled up
if the spiders eat their young</p>

<p><small>These are really old lyrics but now they sort of feel like a poem.</small></p>

        <title>Illusion</title>
        <link>2000/02/illusion</link>
        <description><p>I feel the hard line of decision
The fangs of necessity at throat
And your majesty of illusion which
Makes me bow. If fragility is a crime
It is yours, exquisitely - if
Passion is your dream then let us
Walk together, sleeping and
Growing not old. Too much
is a word from your lips, and sometimes
Too little. There are reasons for
No reason and lies painting truth about
Ecstasy remembered and loveless projection
And where are you, where am I when
Time inches past and pain is only dull;
When money like water puddles in the sun
And the heat is a rough hand pushing?
I am next to your skin with my teeth
Beneath the flower of your pride
With my palms at your weak side
At arms to your defense.</p>

<p>Be it for you that I am invisible
Be it your name that holds thick pleasure
For this soldier at peace.
Be it unspoken the conversation,
And unwritten the pact that
Brings my food to your table and
your fingers to my cheek, your words
to my canvas and if I regret
again, as I did being lost, it will be that
I wasn't lost with you
Sooner. Because this is a shadow fallen,
We are a wooden floor together, uncracked</p>

<p>There is nothing else</p>

        <description><p>One more day and one more war
pennies wasted love endured
one more chance to stand up
you're a seed in my mind
or the way I see the downside
it's a blessing
a blessing in diguise</p>

<p>in my lap with nothing on
checking out pictures of movie stars
you don't have to say it
it's the curse of the wise
to not love anything twice
we've got a blessing
a blessing in diguise</p>

        <description><p>Some one built this place on top of trash
a hill beside the lake of concrete ash
windows up against the water
silence fell but someone caught her</p>

<p>I'm taking a long way down
sinking my teeth into the ground</p>

<p>Drifting through every working day
I forget what everyone has to say
but it's all right, no one remembers anyway
I went to college but why was that
I'm starting where everyone starts out at
but it's all right, I got a really hip doormat</p>

<p>I should find a place to settle down
sink these worn out teeth into the ground
windows up against the water
silence fell but someone caught her</p>

<p>I'm taking a long way down
sinking my teeth into the ground</p>

<p>I've been waiting for something good
you know what, it takes longer than it should
I guess I'm standing where my grandfather stood
What if nothing could stop me now
I've gone and painted a doorway out
It's natural to follow your instincts down</p>

        <description><p>If there's a future in my hands
some navigation to be planned
over this strange and simple nest by the ocean
Bodies stacked above the earth
we are a nation giving birth
to the first machine alive in the city
May the sun still rise for us all in the city</p>

<p>Every day begin the same
Let the rage step out of place
in this strange and simple space by the ocean
If I am deaf then save your breath
If I am blind don't waste your time
These illusions are my pride in the city
May the sun still rise for us all in the city</p>

<p>stolen cars and ego boosting
Real good news but more confusion
Bank of America my favorite parody
they suck so bad they must need some charity</p>

<p>When the minutes turn to years
and the war chiefs come to peace
I won't be lying face down in the city
May the sun still rise for us all in the city</p>

        <link>1999/10/no-doubt</link>
        <description><p>This is the world ugly
sullen but not without sunshine
when I remember the seasons
they are like shadows. In the name
of progress my days are bleak soldiers
This is shallow love,  surfaced
cold and wet. If we build
from this a pleasant shelter no
doubt will I drown.</p>

<p>Drown in emptiness, blank
oxygen thats feeds nothing
loud and open, unheard emotion
words perfectly wrong
moments of clear blindness
gone numb. To meet love
with love is the effort of a lifetime,
a goal with no end. I cannot
smile in compensation
or laugh despite sour words. I
have wandered into this
I must not wander out.
All actions will be deliberate,
Let no one say I fell into
this grave. Let them
see that I dug it first.</p>

        <title>Between</title>
        <link>1999/10/between</link>
        <description><p>Love is a sad word sometimes
With memories attached
Like stars in the sky. Yours
Is a galaxy, behind the curtain
Of everyday thoughts. Deep
Affectionate scars on the cheek
Of a universe. I have never
Lost hope this way, this world
Has never been so removed. I am losing
The fight that was to be my last.
And you, still perfect
The way the past can be perfect
Unspoiled the way beauty
Remains. There are no happy
Secrets with me now. My exit
Was no secret, my loss is nothing
Of a secret. I am learning of myself
humanity, destiny
But not of love. Time's fingers
Have pushed me away from
What I remember and there is but
Madness. But I am halfway to nowhere
And despite your enchanting presence
There is no path from here to reach you.</p>

<p>Let no one say that I fell into this grave
Let them see that I dug it first.</p>

<p> So between the days I reach to you,
Your eyes are still with me. And behind
The hours of work that we share, empty
Responsible and serious
I know that I would bring pleasure to you
For lunch. In a letter
Or with powerful thoughts. But there are
Long highways sprawling between us,
And my body is stuck
Between the beach and the mountains
Between strength and forgiveness
Between love and true love.
At a time where life is mostly
Time-lined stressed and blind
sweet bitter broken
and fixed, I lose vision
and sometimes hope. That maybe
better is tomorrow, and again
unbroken are you as
I wish. May the autumn moon
Shine on better days to come,
Your foolish once lover
Is not yet home</p>

        <link>1999/09/sucker</link>
        <description><p>I took a ride past the edge of town
stopped the car and put my ego down
took a walk and a look around
I found what I was looking for
Everybody wants to be a star
I know that because ot's in my heart
doesn't matter who the fuck you are
we all want to make it
If it was a gift you would take it</p>

<p>I've been down and out and sometimes sour
but I got skills and I got power
ther's a sucker born every hour
and I'm not like that
so it's not so bad</p>

<p>Survival is the only teacher
whiskey's good but love is sweeter
I'm on time when I go to meet her
and I try to bring a gift
No one wants to go unwanted
No one starts to not get started
If you've been in love you've been broken-hearted
but time keeps on picking up speed
and we learn from the ways we bleed</p>

<p>I've been down and out and sometimes sour
but I got skills and I got power
ther's a sucker born every hour
and I'm not like that
so it's not so bad</p>

<p>I spent time in the handout line
I washed dishes for some fucked up guy
I stole bread and kisses and bottles of wine
but that don't matter to me now
because I'm alive and well somehow</p>

<p>I've been down and out and sometimes sour
but I got skills and I got power
ther's a sucker born every hour
and I'm not like that
so it's not so bad</p>

it falls before my eyes
These faces have grown older
this road is filled with lies</p>

<p>I've been watching closely
without going inside
I'm just resting my feet
These prices are too high</p>

<p>Every day is one
every day is one step closer
to the highest place
on this funky roller coaster
but it should be enough
to not want anything too much
except for your sweet touch
and a place to put my stuff</p>

<p>I hear the fires burning
like angels through a door
why do words stay with me
like scratches on the floor?</p>

        <link>1999/09/forget-you</link>
        <description><p>In a restless dream you come to me
They say that love is blind but I can see
That there's something here, too soon to tell
what it is, what it is, whatever it is - I know it well
but nothing, nothing is for sure</p>

<p>So tell me one more time what you think of me
I want to know again what a lucky day it's been
I try not to think too much but you can still hear the wheels turning
That must be the hopes and the probes returning
but nothing, nothing is for sure</p>

<p>But when I look at you
singing in a cage
Eternally your eyes
put you on a stage
and when you come around
as everyone must do
don't forget about me
because I won't forget about you</p>

<p>The days go by and I don't try to count them
why do people need to know what surrounds them?
I won't ask you questions, and I won't try to know
I won't try to keep you but I won't let you go
and nothing, nothing is for sure</p>

<p>But when I look at you
singing in a cage
Eternally your eyes
put you on a stage
and when you come around
as everyone must do
don't forget about me
because I won't forget about you</p>

        <description><p>What I never want to say
but I say it anyway
and blame it on the traffic
There's a phrase for what went on
like a voice becomes the song
the transfer of anger</p>

<p>But all the things that get me by
they should be here for a while
like the California sky
like the California sky</p>

<p>What I have when I get home
Someone here for me alone
It puts me back on top
All I wanted was enough
Now I almost have too much
I just push out my borders</p>

<p>And the things that get me high
they should be here for a while
like my Hollywood at night
like the California sky</p>

<p>If  the Sherriff's on your trail
If you're not making the sales
Just put it on my shoulder
If you don't get to sleep at night
If your dress won't fit you right
Just put your tears on my shoulder</p>

        <description><blockquote><small>This is the poem that started a downward spiral in the relationship I brought to LA with me in 1999. We arrived in the Spring and by August we were just at each other's throats.

We were sharing a computer at the time, and my GF found this poem and emailed it to me at work with the headline: <strong>what's up with this</strong>?
</small></blockquote>


<p>I should not
listen so well
or remember the emotion
at the expense of detail. I
had been told such wonderful things
about my perfect illusion that
I also thought it was no different.
My strengths are beginning to
become weaknesses,
liabilites. Unplanned explanations
And I have nowhere to turn
except inward. Again
retreat, apology again
selfish martyrdom
again aggressive surrender.
I have such pride
in small things and large
feelings, giant
shadows and short friendships
vast oceans of recycled bitterness
and I spit all day red reasons,
blood-red spirit
that never flies. I asked for
everything here
I dreamed of the hope
that would greet me like a mother
greets a newborn and I
found traces
Nothing more. So if I
speak painfully and if
my truth doesn't fit you
If you cannot understand my words
then read your book. And
the insult is your creation
because honesty should never be
qualified. I
apologize for my soul
and love is embittered, I break
my stride and love falls
I follow your whim
and love is trivialized. So
we can make a new pact and
you can ponder petty victory
because my need is greater,
and because you have a woman's army
but you have lost the
unretrieveable. My heart
no longer burns with your image.
It grows cold</p>

        <description><p>just this little stash of survival
never had a moment to think
radio voices sound like someone I know
moonlight makes me want to have a drink
I listen to the rhythm of the traffic
hiding in the silence I project
push me through the womb of the future
bear me as an infant to protect
an island on the ocean planet 'solo'
wailing of the unborn tragedy
wiping from my eyes the mess of martyrs
the burden of my passage through the freeze</p>

        <link>1996/10/september</link>
        <description><p>  In September I see boots before
  the first rain, vast migrant flocks
  flying before the last late sunset
  threatens: a strange, nervous pox
  which might never find a certain cure
  where the stricken fly in nervous flocks</p>

<p>  In September I can't focus, I
  am estranged, staring out
  at the passional leaves so proud
  to be falling so many
  dreams happily dying and by
  each day these old colors flushing out.</p>

<p>  Is that not the way, in September
  of all things answering to
  love? To be sudden, elegant
  and trampled like the fallen truth
  in September when time is so fast
  and every moment is the last</p>

        <link>1991/01/if-i-am-arrogant-so-be-it</link>
        <description><blockquote>
This was copied from my book - in 1991 which was my first year in college. It can be seen as a sort of poetic exercise. I was at the time (and still am) enamored of E.E. Cummings and his creative use of punctuation, as well as his style of bending grammatical rules at his will. At this point, I was not yet even a committed Poetry major. Imagine 4 books full with poems like this written in the first 2 years of college, and you can see how I finally came to understand myself through poetry. I forced myself to write a poem every night before bed, whatever the circumstances.
</blockquote>


<p>If I am arrogant so be it
I'm too poor for presents
But I'll make it worth your while</p>

<p>A thousand faces are mirrored
Here, in an absent type
Of company
A tethered slave, is fighting
Now, for his right
To be free.
Their eyes are cold,
And pitiful
As they watch for some important
Shame, they treat life as a
Mystery, and not -
As they should -
Like a game.
Hypnosis.
All is one, I
Being, I
Am within that one
Which makes that one
Me.
All these faces
Are laughing - they are
Mine. Or
Parts (of me)
At themselves.
The Gaping Mouth will eat you
Now - is better than
Waiting (I hate having to
Wait. That your neck is
Exposed - not your mix
Of breed (we just like
Would probably just cut it off
At the jugular
To suck like crabs legs
And suck
Or any other armored sea food.
I like it when
Kcrk, khrck
They crunch. It's all in
The preparation / like a good
Crouton.
A mixed, tossed, lively little
Salad of souls with your
Choice of greek</p>

        <title>When I was One I had just begun</title>
        <link>1981/01/when-i-was-one-i-had-just-begun</link>
        <description><p>This is the first poem I wrote that I am proud of. I was six years and eight months old. It primarily makes me think of two things. One is that I was clearly first a poet - it was my first natural form of expression, along with possibly art but that is so common for kids of that age that it does not seem noteworthy. The fact that I was writing poems at such an early age means that must be my true calling. I was writing poems as early as 1978, and by 1981 I had a certain facility with it. Of course, I was sort of lacking in big concepts but that's why I like this one - it has a remarkable sense of self-awareness and mortality, which is arguably the richest of deep concepts.</p>

<p>Here it is:</p>

<blockquote>When I was One,
I had just begun.
When I was two
I was nearly new.
When I was three
I was hardly me.
When I was Four,
I was not much more.
When I was Five,
I was just alive.
But now I am Six,
I'm as clever as clever
So I think I'll be six
now for ever and ever.</blockquote>

<p>Notice the slightly random sense of capitalization, I was still figuring out the rules. :)</p>

<blockquote>UPDATE: It has come to my attention that the above poem is identical to a poem called "Now We Are Six" by A.A. Milne, so I can't take credit for that one. I'm not sure why I would have copied a poem like that but I am assuming that was actually the assignment, to just copy something. Maybe it was a handwriting challenge. Anyway, that explains why I only got a 'check' (no 'check plus'). the poem was great, but not mine and not all physically written all that well, perhaps hence the average grade. So keep reading below for a few more poems that I did write at that age.
</blockquote>


<p>The second thing this makes me think is that I was so lucky to have such a great school system. Looking back through my 'school papers' from those years - thankfully my parents kept it all - I am amazed to find so many poems. I think there are about a hundred poems from the 4 years between 1978 and 1981 - that is crazy to me. Many of them are sort of mundane and not that memorable, but I was finding a style and working it out and it is obvious that it was not just one teacher but most if not all of them that encouraged me to write poems because they could see that I liked doing it. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montessori_method">Montessori</a> school for the win. I really can't overemphasize how that sort of environment helped me become the person that I am.</p>

<p>Here are two more that I enjoy, from just 2 months before my 7th birthday:</p>

<blockquote>Running Moon - March 13 1981

Sometimes when we drive out at night
I see the half moon thin and white.
It runs beside us like a hound
It's there whenever I turn around.
I say, "good moon, come on
good moon. It won't be long
we'll be home soon." And when
we stop there in the sky
the moon stands still
as still as I.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>Untitled - April 1 1981

Little snail,
Dreaming you go.
Weather and rose
Is all you know.
Weather and rose
Is all you see
Drinking the dewdrop's
Mystery.

Sky Meet Sea by Krister Axel<br/>
Reviewed by: Charles Harrelson</p>




<blockquote>
 A lot can be said about a CD cover. You can look at a metal band you you might expect blood and guts vains and sharp claws. Maybe a country CD would have a horse on it and a pop band may have the band photo with everybody in full makeup. When you see a CD cover with a sunset you tend to think instrumental love songs or new age music. That was kind of what I expected when I popped Sky meets Sea into my CD player. 

To my surprise, track 1 was an indie rocker with a bit of a punk feel with lyrics sung by someone with a voice between Leon Redbone and Leon Russell. The music took me a few minutes to recover as I was expecting a soft flute with some seagulls and ocean breeze in the background.

After I recovered from the initial surprise I settled in and listened to one of the best Independent CD's released this year. Krister is a one man hit writing musician. He writes the music that gives you goose bumps and makes the hairs on your neck stand up. I found myself deeply involved with Before the Rain and Celebrate Tonight. Had either of these songs been written and performed by a Beatle it may have gone down as a song on par with "Something" or "Yesterday."

Songwriting coaches should have this CD as required listening. Song structure is on par with any of the best songs written over the past 3 decades. I simply could not find anything wrong with this CD, other then the CD cover. This CD needs to be in everyones collection and in their i-Pod. You simply can not go wrong. I would have only wished the CD ended with Celebrate Tonight (not second to last). After a song like that you simply have nowhere else to go.
In the Studio:
Not much I can say about the studio mix. Other than it was brilliant. The bottom line was, this is a first class offering from lyrics, to song structure to performance and recording. 

Conclusion: 
This is clearly one of the best CD I have listened to this year! Great job Krister, you will be added to the top 25 Indie CD's. 

Clearly, 10 stars.......</blockquote>

<p>
I guess the verdict is in on <b>Arms Around the River</b>. It has proven to be in a pretty short time the album that has so far generated the best / most effusive reviews. 
It feels good to be getting recognized, I think there is a slow and steady rise going on here. I don't think it's a surprise that almost half of my sales now are coming from out of the country - mostly iTunes UK, Europe, and Australia. I love that I have no idea who any of these people are.

<blockquote>
I already like an album that has a song called Impeach Bush.

These songs were written around the time of the London Terrorist attack in 2005. He was there and saw how it affected the people living in and around [London].

Axel has a sort of slow, drawly vocal style. His voice is very infectious. I could listen to it all day. The songwriting is bluesy, with lots of rhythm and heartfelt lyrics. Good stuff.

by IntelligentPop.com, August 2007

<blockquote>
Described as roots-rock and likened to the Dave Matthews Band in its press release, this artist actually reminds us more strongly of Gavin DeGraw and Randy Newman with their bluesy, bayou-accented singing styles... Axel has a lovely, warm voice, does not sound insincere, and achieves several moments of real beauty on this album. Overall, Axel belts less and sounds more sincere than other southern bluesmen. He’s generally mellow, which along with some lyrical and reverb-drenched electric guitar work is whence comes the dreamy beauty he sometimes achieves... The songwriting is thoroughly competent, the musicianship throughout is first-rate and the recording quality is terrific. Overall, a very strong effort. Nice work.

<blockquote>

From the outside, the Hotel Cafe is an unassuming grayish building with a small sign on the front door directing visitors to the alley next to the building. Another sign on the side of the building leads you down a long, unremarkable alley to the back entrance. Once inside, you’re treated to a comfortable, hip atmosphere-dim lighting, a dark wooden bar, exposed brick walls, and red velvet curtains.

It’s a fitting place for musician-singer-songwriter Krister Axel to celebrate the release of his new CD, Arms Around the River. Like the building in which he’s playing, Krister and his band make a modest sight onstage-they appear more like a group of friends playing a friend’s party than a gig in the heart of Hollywood. But just seconds into the first song, “Head in the Rain,” their professional musicianship and talent is immediately and pleasingly apparent. The earthy, roots rocking combination of acoustic and electric guitar, organ, harmonica, and solid rhythm section is infectious and easy to like. After the first verse, you’re hooked. The song rises from Krister singing soft lyrics over his solo organ to a spirited and full sounding all instruments jam, the mood of the music changing with the complexity and intensity of the sound.

Moments later, “True Believer” makes me think I’ve heard this band before, but where? I know they get no radio play, Krister produced his own album, and I happen to know he has a day job. There is something very familiar about these songs-the poignant earnestness of his writing is very appealing and easy with which to identify. This touching earnestness comes out again in the next song, “Stay,” which is a beautiful ballad that is very emotive-the kind of music that can make you rethink an argument with a loved one, or turn that afternoon’s road rage into a silly, distant memory. The mood of the melody is slow and sad-mostly expressing personal longing-that somehow manages to convey an inspiring notion of graceful wisdom throughout. It’s also packaged between an upbeat intro and a hopeful closing riff that leaves the listener feeling extremely satisfied. This is serious hit song material; original music that is at once evocative of Dave Matthews, Coldplay and Blues Traveler.

And so the evening passed. Song after song, Krister and his band continuing to impress with a range of interesting and intricately constructed songs replete with tight stops, tempo changes, tasty hooks, and interesting personal lyrics. After playing the first five songs from his new album, Krister (playing acoustic guitar) and the band (Karen Teperberg on drums, Matt Delvecchio on bass, and Mike Freas on electric guitar, and guest Nick Blechman on mandolin) played a brand new, as yet unrecorded song, that is a lot of fun and slightly reminiscent of The Cars.

Krister Axel is not your typical Hollywood performer-he’s not trying to be anyone or anything, he just plays what he feels, and it is good. He plays earnest songs from the heart, like the touching ballad written for his sister’s wedding, “Something Beautiful.” His enthusiasm onstage when interacting with the audience is also very evident and engaging. The only complaint one could have about Krister’s music is that his songs are too short, especially for live performance. This became more evident during the band’s finale, “I’m the Gun,” a strong blues number featuring the dueling harmonicas of guests Judy Rudin (who also played on the first few songs of the set) and Chet Dixon, in which the whole band treated the crowd to a raucous extended jam that was by far the most fun of the evening.

Not to say that the rest of the show wasn’t fun-in fact every song is great. Krister Axel and his band play a rootsy, sometimes poppy, blues-influenced rock and roll that is impossible not to like. We could all stand to hear more of this music. Somebody give this guy a distribution deal please!

<p>A review of <a href="http://axelradio.com/album/arms-around-the-river"><b>Arms Around the River</b></a> <i>
by RandomTracks.com, May 2008
</i><br></p>

<blockquote>
Krister Axel is a self taught musician, poet, and songwriter based out of Los Angeles. His appealing voice is the perfect delivery apparatus for his roots based southern rock music.
The album is incredibly well produced. The sound quality is excellent and [the] music is a perfect accompaniment to long road trips and days when you just want the earthy sound that is Krister Axel. [A] smooth and classic southern rock sound.
Track 2, "True Believer"... is probably my most favorite from the album. It is certainly the one that keeps ringing in my head... the production is amazing.
Track 8, "I'm the Gun," kicks things off with some nice rhythm guitar work that also brings the tempo up a bit. [This song is] well constructed with alternating instrumentation and drum riffs [that] add a lot of musical interest. The Nashville/blues influences clearly shine through. Great backing vocals, and some interesting vocal layering, add an extra dimension at the end.
The last track, "Impeach Bush" is a political song that made me think of an updated Woody Guthrie, very different than the rest of the album. Axel delivers that message of change in a very appealing and musically solid way.
Krister Axel's Arms around the River is a solid southern rock album that has rightfully earned a permanent place in my CD collection, and has become a frequent visitor in my car's CD player.

<blockquote>
Krister Axel, born in Paris, has been writing and performing roots and blues music for 20 years. He began his career as a songwriter performing in the streets of Paris, then New York City, Madison and finally Los Angeles. Krister Axel claims the legendary Chris Whitley as the greatest influence on his writing. His work encompasses pop songwriting as well as a roots-based approach to instrumental pieces commissioned for movie projects. His credits include pieces for the soundtracks to Hate Crime and A Colombia and licensing with NBC Networks, Regent Theaters, and many others. Most recently, Krister had a few songs placed on the season 5 dvd of Friday Night Lights (TV series) which has been very successful in generating interest about his music. These songs are Illuminate the Sky and Georgia Rain (both from the EP Swexico), as well as Something Beautiful from the album Arms Around the River.

Krister Axel has a unique style of singing, described by fans as a sort of Bill Withers meets Jamiroquai. He is a self-taught musician who started on the piano and eventually discovered the acoustic guitar.</blockquote>
