			<p>I promise myself to keep track of everything…</p>

<p>I met Jen on Thursday. Just before our show at O'Briens, Nicole Eadington sends me an email and tells me she wants me to meet her roommate. It was Misty's going away party- who looked amazing, as usual, and I vaguely remember her bending over to show me some cleavage and bending over in the other direction to show me her ass. Body language is so telling but I don't always read it… it's almost better that way, everything makes sense later.
Anyway, we sat and talked together the whole time… I went through two drinks, riveted by our own conversation. We talked about Europe, and art, her growing up in southern California, college (?) semester in Europe (Paris), private high school starts with an F…
That's it.
Tuesday, I call her, hey I called you at work on Saturday but you must have closed early because it was raining…
Nicole sends me another email, so are you taking Jen out on Thursday?
I call, she says says yes, I pick her up, we go to the liquid kitty.
Two drinks each - two kettle tonics for her, one rosebud cocktail and a magical Christian for me…
We talk about Europe, and art, and the war, it's just not the same anymore…
So hey, you wanna go see the ocean?
We're parking, no not the pier because it's completely sketchy…
We'll keep walking - except she has the wrong shoes - why not sit right here?</p>

<p>Neither of us have done this in a while, been so close to the moon and the ocean at the same time, quiet Santa Monica and the sound of waves…
We keep talking, and I lean in, ever so slightly.</p>

<p>It was very slight.</p>

<p>I immediately feel her face, next to mine, turning towards me, her hands come up and we are kissing, ferociously, and I'm proud I didn't smoke that day…
This continues, and I start squeezing her legs, the way I like to do, and she presses towards me, and there are very quiet noises, but I hear them… I start unzipping her pants, what Are you doing? And I say I don't know, until I find her clit with my fingers (silk front of her panties and she's completely smooth) at which point I say - thaaats what I'm looking for and she's moaning, and I reach around her ass with my other hand and can lift her, just a little, around my finger which doesn't go in but keeps knocking.
I think she came, in any case she said thank you (although that might have been for zipping her up) and she said that was just like high school and I think she meant it in a good way…
We kissed in the car for almost too long before she got out but that was after she invited me over the next night, because Nicole wasn't going to be there and that's why…
I just trimmed my pubic hairs gleefully in the mirror for the first time, I am 28 years old. Let me tell you the story.</p>

<p>3/21/03 8:28:22 PM</p>

<p>I'm getting dressed…
It takes me longer and longer… there's never anything left.
Show tonight… I came home this afternoon, and worked on the Early Ride to Vegas song. I love that I can do that - there was not much going on today.</p>

<p>And that whole craigslist ad was very successful… I only wish I tried it next week instead, but we'll see what the turnout is. It might even be better that I unleashed it a week early - I can always repost. It's nice to have new names on the list, and it makes for more hits on my website, at very least. I had fun answering all of the emails today… It's amazing, I was just thinking about how I used to fool around with Nicole donahough in Madison after bartime, and how we had to either meet up at the Plaza right at bar time, or I'd have to try and catch her when she just got home… otherwise there was no way to get in touch. We didn't have cell phones yet… how funny.</p>

<p>Heard a Curtis Mayfield song I could cover someday… track 7.
I could really work my falsetto, someday very soon, when I just altogether pull the plug on this smoking. My birthday is coming up, I should do it then… The world is all mine. I wonder if these solo shows will serve to really build some momentum. It's not entirely impossible…</p>

<p>Here are the songs I'm thinking of doing -</p>

<p>Get This Waiting
Tragic
Centerstone
When they take me in
Waterfall
Brooklyn
Try to listen
Dernier Coup
Won't Fade - but probably not</p>

<p>Maybes (if I can clean them up) -</p>

<p>Early ride to vegas
sometime</p>
