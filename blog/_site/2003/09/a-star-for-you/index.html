<p>What do I see now?<br />
You've hidden your freedom<br />
Beneath your desire<br />
The known, the unknown<br />
You have opened up this river<br />
Flowing between love and fear<br />
The answer is that you are blessed<br />
And no one knows better than you<br />
How to build heaven<br />
Do not insult the world<br />
with apologies - the beauty of your<br />
heart never sleeps. Trust<br />
that your voice carries strength<br />
that your decisions are right<br />
because you made them. You<br />
will be loved<br />
as you are now<br />
as you were then<br />
because destiny makes no mistake<br />
you cannot hide from yourself<br />
any more than you can run away<br />
be glad for that precious pain<br />
there is poetry under your skin;<br />
you are aware<br />
of the human tragedy - that we fall<br />
madly through time<br />
towards death<br />
and truth<br />
in the span of 30,000 sunsets<br />
with only love to guide us</p>


<p>how sad<br />
and exquisite</p>
