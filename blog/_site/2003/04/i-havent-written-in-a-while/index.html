			<p class="teaser_info"><p>I haven't written in a while.</p><br />
<br />
<p>I am thinking about eloquence, about the language that grew from Rilke at the letter writing table, who was my age in his first one. Only 100 years or so, and the very act of thinking has abbreviated itself. I see him as a sort of aristocrat, but I think this a misjudgment. Artists in those days were caught between society and poverty - with little to show for their efforts. I know not how he made his travels but I feel in my heart that he was not affluent at all.<br />
And of course, the language between Van Gogh and Gauguin, in that long French script, with such literal discussion of physical form…<br />
I have passed this legacy of Rilke on to a few now, and I believe that the world will benefit. I just want someone at some point to understand how much I have given to this, in such painless sacrifice - to the music, to the strings on a guitar, to the words on a page. It is no secret, anymore, to me - that solitude and the scrutiny of emotion are at the center of artistic focus… Rilke understood this, and led me also to understand. That one has only to look inward, at the sky within.<br />
Awaken the sleeping voices, the opinions of ghosts and the noises of motion. The colors of metaphor, the magic of tension, the animals of the mind… I am now my own friend and muse, I direct my own consciousness and I heed inspiration above all else. I love my own voice, written and spoken in lustrous syllables. I elevate. I bring.<br />
I am trying to lead now and this is new for me.<br />
I give gifts, I am honorable. I shed light on what I can. I am open and honest, and for this I have recently finished being doubtful. There is far too little time to be what I am not… I have often decided on small adjustments and made them stick but for the most part I carry the same colors, the same patterns and the same stripes. I am utterly who I am and nothing besides that and I am grateful now for that identity… For as long as I can remember, I have been on the inside with myself, I have sensed my own desires and passions and commitments - my own rhythms of being and I have not faltered. God bless me, I have never lied to myself. About relationships and friendships and I have always held myself accountable to mercy, glory and defeat. You cannot take away from me that which guides me, it is a valley below me and a red-eyed sunset, the smoke from distant fires and a current from the ocean… It is the words that bring themselves to life like paper dolls on fire and become ashes before they take their first step…<br />
It is love, love of my friends and my songs and their own cohabitation. I am in the hand of destiny who will write my name across the world in soft blue letters like the sky on paper. My songs will be heard by the coast, by the waves and the cars passing through in the California afternoon.<br />
I will not lose my hope or my grip. These are the days of calculated mischief.</p><br />
