                crossroads
            </h2>
			<p class="teaser_info"><p>So maybe this is the crossroads. It does seem that good things like to happen simultaneously, as if to force a difficult decision. That's probably what amounts to resolve, the sense of direction, and fate.<br />
I wish so much to see all things at once, but sadly I realize that I am only to understand what is necessary. My oldest addiction, the playing of music, makes itself known in many ways and I have learned nothing except that I want - or rather that I have - no control.<br />
I will always be running back and forth, chasing paths that conflict in small ways, and I would give so much to have a glimpse at what I am building.<br />
I understand that I am to be alone until something changes, until I feel like I can share all parts of myself. I fear to some degree that I would be judged, for my bad habits as well as my good ones, and I have yet to come to a conclusion about myself, as to what parts are worth defending… the obvious answer is that I should be proud of all that I am, which is for the most part true but there is always the feeling that I am less and have achieved less than what my fortune deserves. And that is at the root of it, this feeling that all that I have and all that I will be is somehow to be less than what my mind fashions. And from this I draw the anguish, the bitterness, and the wisdom that I am so small with such enormous designs. This is the starting point, and I will spread my wings as best I can.<br />
Of all the truths that surround me, I choose to believe that I am great… that I have wandered through darkness very quickly, and my intuition serves me well.<br />
I am thankful for the equation, for the balance of faith that belongs to me. I feel my own beauty like warm skin on these bones; a face that smiles back at me and will always have pride. I am a living potion, in equal parts red flame and white snow. My fathers before me stand tall, and my blood is alive with magic of the earth. I shape myself in the image of my ambition and I know that I am right to be obsessed. It is what is needed.</p><br />
