<p>This is an important question. I am am the youngest in my generation and it seems that I am starting to get requests from people in my family for the song they want to be played at their funeral. Being the family musician and songwriter, it is fitting that I be tasked with putting playlists together when the people I love start moving up to heaven. Also, I plan on living forever so that way I'll be around.</p>

<p>So far, I've got a request for a Krister Axel song and a French folk song. May it be another hundred years before I have to honor any of these requests.</p>
