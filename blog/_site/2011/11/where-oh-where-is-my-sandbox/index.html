			<p>It ain't easy being a <strong>Mac</strong> person.</p>

<p>First you have to find a good game, and then you have to figure out how to play it on your Mac. For example, I sort of got <strong>DDO</strong> to play on my Mac via Crossover, but it was buggy enough to be annoying and functional enough to be somewhat compelling which was not a good place to be. The short of it was that I could never really group up because there was a decent chance that my client would crash at any given moment. As anyone who has played <strong>DDO</strong> will tell you, you eventually need to group with people because of the strong requirements for specific classes - certain instances need a really good thief, for example - coupled with the really annoying need for other live players to coordinate opening certain doors together. An example:</p>

<blockquote>You stand here, I'll go into the other room, hit the switch that both closes the door that I just went through and then enables a switch for YOU to hit that will reopen the door for me!</blockquote>


<p>It's either an ingenious way to encourage grouping, or an insidious way to render your 'hirelings' more or less useless just when you need them. It depends who you ask. If you ask me, it's an annoying way of grinding your solo play to halt where you have to leave because you are SOL and are doomed to take a penalty whenever you come back. Sweet!</p>

<p>Still one of favorite sandbox titles to date is a little-appreciated gem from Steam called <strong>Tycoon City: New York</strong>. I really loved playing that game but it too was pretty buggy. You would have to save incessantly just on the off chance that the game would crash, and even then occasionally the save file itself would corrupt and you would be lucky if you could restart without having to do a poor man's reboot by yanking the plug out of the wall.</p>

<p>I have also been revisiting the <strong>Tropico</strong> series, lately release number 4. I'm still not sure if I liked 3 better because although they made some things better they took away some of the detail-oriented browsing of individual citizens. I feel like you used to 'know' your citizens better and were more encouraged to select them and follow them around in 3. Now, the AI is noticeably better - people actually find things that they are looking for, but it feels less personal. I like more detail, not less, and I think in some ways they caved to the '<em>derr, this is complicated</em>' crowd and dumbed the title down in some ways to make it more palatable. Good luck with that one, Kalypso.</p>

<p>All I want is a crafting community with a player-centric economy, decent solo play, player-built housing and good customization options for your avatar. I don't think that is too much to ask. So far, <a href="http://www.originsofmalu.com/" target="_blank">Origins of Malu</a> seems to be putting something along those lines together. I will be following along closely.</p>
