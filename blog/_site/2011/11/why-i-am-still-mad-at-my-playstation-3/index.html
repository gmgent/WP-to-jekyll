	                            <p><p>It started out bad, I should say that from the start. Maybe those are the relationships that seem the most rewarding at first - like maybe if you try hard enough, you can fix it, and then you will have created your own happiness. For me, I bought a PS3 slim model when it came out, not because there was anything I wanted to play but because I was getting ready for <strong>The Agency</strong> to come out.</p>

<p>Note to people that do things in anticipation of other things: bad idea. That does not always work out - they kept on pushing back the release date and then they pulled the plug. My hopes were dashed. <strong>Dragon Age</strong> got boring really fast, and <strong>Borderlands</strong> did too. My dream of playing a worthy MMO on PS3 was turning to dust.</p>

<p>And then I discovered Hulu. They had a client for PS3. That is great, I said to myself. I can watch my favorite shows on the big screen instead of my laptop. Maybe this PS3 will be useful after all. Now of course we are talking about software, and I can't reasonably hold PS3 accountable for the performance of someone else's app. It turns out that the Hulu app for PS3 is really buggy and laggy and just makes you feel dirty for using it. Also, most of the shows on Hulu are not licensed for 'television', whatever that means. Don't we all just have monitors now? I'm disappointed, but that's not the fault of Sony, right?</p>

<p>Well, technically that's true, but as a company like Apple will tell you, it doesn't matter if it's not your fault. That's a big plus for a closed system because you get to actually control for quality. Who else is big on a closed system? Sony. You see where I'm going with this? Besides, there may very well have been some platform issues that contributed to the Hulu app fail for PS3. At this point we may never know - but I'm starting not to like Sony. The only thing that was definitely NOT their fault was the licensing issue - and I could have lived with that. Or even if they just had a decent browser that actually parses modern javascript, things would have been fine.</p>

<p>And THEN, there was the mother of all PR losses - <a href="http://axel.me/5b">Sonygate</a>, you could call it. I had a few accounts hijacked, nothing major happened to me - but it could have been really ugly. More than 70 million people were affected by this, and that is <strong>their</strong> number. The real number is probably higher. What bothered me the most was how long it took Sony to respond. I had no idea what was going on for close to a week (if I remember correctly), and that was time that my data could have used against me had I been unlucky. The story finally broke, and I ordered a new credit card like millions of others but sitting on their hands while figuring out how to spin the story did not endear Sony to me.</p>

<p>For now, there is a glorified dvd player with its HDMI cable already pilfered from it living in my house, disconnected, dusty and presumably bored.</p>

<p>Maybe a game will come along some day with the power to bring it back to life.</p>
