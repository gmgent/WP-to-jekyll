                past positive and future oriented
            </h2>
			<p>This is a reaction to an RSA Animate video called <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3oIiH7BLmg">The Secret Powers of Time</a> where:</p>

<blockquote>Professor Philip Zimbardo conveys how our individual perspectives of time affect our work, health and well-being...</blockquote>


<p>I would like to make the case that rationality dictates a hybrid philosophy. I think a combination of 'Past Positive' and future-oriented is the only logical choice.</p>

<p>Past Positive I think is necessary because it plays right into the most human of needs - the need to leave a lasting impression on the world. Call it an illusion if you will, ashes to ashes and all of that, but as a creative and an artist I know very well that most if not all artisanal pursuits deal with this - that we all want to create something that is worthy of immortality. If you are a painter, you want your art in a museum where it will live (presumably) beyond your own lifetime; if you are a songwriter you want your songs to be recorded by the next generation of artists, or for your own recordings to live on as a shining example of one's own time period; if you are a writer, you want your work (book, essay, screenplay) to reach an eminent status where it circles back around and influences young minds over and over again - Catcher in the Rye comes to mind, as a great example of that. What an impressive, infinite and immortal work that is. So I think living partially within the 'Past Positive' paradigm is essential to that sort of emphasis - to create, and to in a sense curate one's own archive of materials. Blogging feeds this need in a sense as well.</p>

<p>To be future-oriented is also important - as distinguished from the 'Transcendental Future' orientation - because as empiricism will suggest the best way to create a positive future is to be positive. Happiness begets smiling but so too does smiling beget happiness. As Gandhi said - 'we must be the change that we wish to see'. I think this is one of the most important truisms in our universe. Spiritually, future orientation is the only way to go - that is, if long-term health and happiness are important to you.</p>

<p>So, simply put, a rational and intelligent being will find a balance between these two time orientations. One might argue that a little present-hedonistic is not bad, but keep in mind - pleasures of the flesh are only meaningful when they are <em>additive</em>. Hedonism only positively affects happiness when it is used 'over the top', so to speak, where the structure for long-term happiness is already in place. For more on that see <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/martin_seligman_on_the_state_of_psychology.html">Martin Seligman on positive psychology</a>.</p>

<p>Also, see <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/mihaly_csikszentmihalyi_on_flow.html">Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi on flow</a> - I think flow is itself a hybrid present-hedonistic and future-oriented phenomenon.</p>
