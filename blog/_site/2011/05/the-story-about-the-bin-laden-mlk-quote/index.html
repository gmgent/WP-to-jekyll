<p>I saw a tweet about it from <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/ClaudeSuper">@ClaudeSuper<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/ClaudeSuper"></a> and I thought it was interesting. I've been seeing this quote moving around Facebook today and I should have realized it was becoming a national news item. The story is from <a href="http://mashable.com/2011/05/03/altered-mlk-quote/">Mashable</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Returning hate for hate multiplies hate, adding deeper darkness to a night already devoid of stars. Darkness cannot drive out darkness: only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate: only love can do that. Hate multiplies hate, violence multiplies violence, and toughness multiplies toughness in a descending spiral of destruction. So when Jesus says “Love your enemies,” he is setting forth a profound and ultimately inescapable admonition…. The chain reaction of evil — hate begetting hate, wars producing more wars — must be broken, or we shall be plunged into the dark abyss of annihilation.

- Martin Luther King</blockquote>


<p>A modified version of this quote has been going around Facebook:</p>

<blockquote><em>I mourn the loss of thousands of precious lives, but I will not rejoice in the death of one, not even an enemy.</em> Returning hate for hate multiplies hate, adding deeper darkness to a night already devoid of stars. Darkness cannot drive out darkness: only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate: only love can do that.</blockquote>


<p>The first sentence (in italics, added by me) was written by <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/jmadly/">Jessica Dovey</a>, and came to be included in a tweet by <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/pennjillette">@pennjillete</a> that quickly went viral. It was incorrectly attributed to MLK in it's entirety, although the first sentence was not his. I think the message is still an important one and I agree with the premise of both the entire quote from MLK as well as the modified one. The world needs love that is for sure.</p>

<p>UPDATE: interesting <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2011/05/03/propaganda_bin_laden/index.html">follow-up piece</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/ggreenwald/">@ggreenwald</a> on the media's role in spinning the story of bin Laden's killing - while possibly NOT holding a gun (he was unarmed), which is what the White House <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0511/54162.html">had said previously</a>.</p>
