                And it's over just like that
            </h2>
			<p class="teaser_info"><p>Now that I am not doing that many shows any more, I feel like each one means more - which is an illusion. Things are what they are and we infuse them with drama and emotion and we compare to things in our past and we wonder why no one sees anything the same way. It is quite a game we play with ourselves, making sense of the nonsensical.</p><br />
<br />
<p>I had fun tonight, I played my new songs, my gorgeous wife was there with some of our friends and I felt like I could just barely taste again the flavor of performance. It's a drug, an intoxicating drug of habit and mystery and fleeting moments of perfection. It is also very much my past, and I realize that playing on a stage will forever make me feel young. Where there is challenge and uncertainty, yet hope, there is a path out of the mundane - the raw creativity of songwriting is what saved my adolescent self from itself, but the slot-machine draw of performance is what saved my adult self from nihilism. That is where I decided to never again care what other people think, to rise and fall as the captain of my own ship, and to feel worthy of anything I could conceive. I owe my wonderful marriage to the confidence I found as a performer - and I found a purpose within the doctrine of musical performance, where for the most part people respect each other and we listen to each other. I've said it before and I'll say it again - I owe my life to music, to songwriting and improvisation. We are all our best selves on stage - partly because we are forced to smile at the camera, partly because we are forced to be optimists in the face of all kinds of adversity, partly because we are doing what we love - and at least in my case, it helps fight the misanthropic tendencies I have in my heart. :)</p><br />
<br />
<p>I made some new friends tonight. I was very happy that everyone was absolutely outstanding. Justine Bennett, B Willing James, Joel Eckels - they all had their personal thing going and my style fit right in.</p><br />
<br />
<p>I got some video from the performance, but the lighting was pretty bad so I'm not sure how useful it will be. In any case, the camera guy did a great job. Matt Renoir - I'm sure guys in his profession have a saying about you are only as good as your lighting. He did the best he could and was a great sport, we talked about doing some work together again very soon.</p><br />
<br />
<p>My take away from this was that I really need to book a full slot, I'm a big fan of Mondays at Room 5 but for me, I really wanted to play a few songs back to back. Next up - find somewhere with good sound and great lighting and do a full set. That way it will be worth it taking HD video of the performance. Clearly I have the right guy for it.</p><br />
