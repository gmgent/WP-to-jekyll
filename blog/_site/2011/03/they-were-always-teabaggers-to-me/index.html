			<p class="teaser_info"><h3>The Strange History of the Teabagger Movement</h3><br />
<br />
<br />
<p>This stuff is so rich. You really can't make it up - reality is so much stranger than fiction.</p><br />
<br />
<p>The first big day for this movement was February 27, 2009. It was the beginnings of the Tea Party, what was then a fringe group funded mainly by <a href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Americans_for_Prosperity">Americans for Prosperity</a> and <a href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Freedom_Works">Freedom Works</a>. There was a young man there with a sign.<br/><br />
<a href="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/d4cd01573a2f6874e5e5f5a547893163.jpg"><img src="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/d4cd01573a2f6874e5e5f5a547893163.jpg" alt="" title="d4cd01573a2f6874e5e5f5a547893163" width="382" height="284" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-804" /></a></p><br />
<br />
<p>The newly frescoed Tea Party was rearing up for a big protest on tax day - April 15th. In the run-up to that, Rachel Maddow <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLsKt4O4Yw8">had some fun</a> at their expense. This set off what can only be called a shit storm.<br/><br />
<a href="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Thank-You-Fox-News-for-Keeping-Us-Infromed.bmp"><img src="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Thank-You-Fox-News-for-Keeping-Us-Infromed.bmp" alt="" title="Thank-You-Fox-News-for-Keeping-Us-Infromed" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-805" /></a><br />
<a href="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Keep-the-Tea-Dump-the-Polititions.bmp"><img src="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Keep-the-Tea-Dump-the-Polititions.bmp" alt="" title="Keep-the-Tea-Dump-the-Polititions" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-806" /></a></p><br />
<br />
<p>All of which made for some pretty silly signage from the linguistically challenged right-wing base. But it gets better.</p><br />
<br />
<p>It's clear that somewhere within the eddies of spin and counter-spin, there was a real lack of homework done by whoever came up with the teabag idea in the first place. The amount of coverage it got was miraculous - and what was great is that you could see at the time that most of the talking heads had not gotten the memo about putting the kibosh on the term 'teabagger' - so it died a very slow death (at least in terms of modern media cycles) and the upshot was nothing short of hilarious.<br />
<a href="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/humble-libertarian-20090330.png"><img src="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/humble-libertarian-20090330.png" alt="" title="humble-libertarian-20090330" width="432" height="422" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-809" /></a><br />
<a href="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/prud-to-be-a-tea-bagger.png"><img src="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/prud-to-be-a-tea-bagger.png" alt="" title="prud-to-be-a-tea-bagger" width="387" height="428" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-810" /></a></p><br />
<br />
<p>It was like watching a car crash in slow motion. Even some of our congresspeople (like Phil Gingrey) got in on the action.<br/><br />
<a href="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/philgrigngey-.png"><img src="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/philgrigngey--300x287.png" alt="" title="philgrigngey-" width="300" height="287" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-811" /></a></p><br />
<br />
<p>Of course, within a few weeks of the Maddow piece the faux outrage and subsequent condemnation began in full force - a specialty of right-wing demagogues. The bullshit was flying fast and thick as the republican money machine was pulling all references to 'teabaggers' from the internets, and basically trying to make it look (as usual) like a liberal conspiracy. Within this time frame, there was a concerted effort to rebrand all teabaggers as 'tea partiers', and it was very effective. It was almost as if the original term had never existed. By the end of the year, redstate (a right wing blog) ran a piece that summed it up nicely.<br/></p><br />
<br />
<p><a href="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/redstate-20091110.png"><img src="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/redstate-20091110-504x1024.png" alt="" title="redstate-20091110" width="504" height="1024" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-813" /></a></p><br />
<br />
<p>The best part of all of this is that in the final end game, the right has come back around and is now again embracing the 'teabagger' meme. First it was on, then it was a liberal conspiracy, then their hand was forced and they had to take it back from the liberals, so it's on again - sort of a nonsensical narrative but that should not be surprising. Anyway, now you have guys like Breitbart trying to again lay claim to the term in a sort of those-liberals-can't-get-their-minds-out-of-the-gutter kind of way. I'm slightly hesitant to <a href="http://biggovernment.com/abreitbart/2010/04/14/im-proud-to-be-a-tea-bagger/">link</a> to the video, but it really is absolutely priceless. Here are some screenshots:</p><br />

<br />
<p>So that is the story of the term <strong>teabagger</strong> - first it had to do with a horribly repressive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_Act">import tax</a>, then 236 years went by, then it had to do with horribly naive demagoguery, then it was spun as a liberal conspiracy, and then it found its true place as a right wing meme.</p><br />
