<p>That's the name of the little guy we saw on our first day of cross country skiing in Le Grand Bornand. We decided to call him the Duke, and figured that we didn't see him again because he was probably too busy hanging out with Fernando back at the hotel.</p>

<p>This is how it happened - the day we got to Le Grand Bornand, the main cross country slope that you can access directly from town was closed for lack of snow, so we were forced to take the bus over to <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/place?ftid=0x478bfa0994e44959:0x2608ab2be373be21&q=france+les+plans+grand+bornand&gl=us&hl=en&dtab=0&sll=45.935559,6.485623&sspn=0.031044,0.06403&ie=UTF8&ll=45.975969,6.388378&spn=0,0&z=13" target="_blank">Les Plans</a>. This was a gorgeous enclosed valley, and it had snowed recently. There were not too many people around, and it was really a beautiful morning. I think it was around 11am by the time we finally were doing our first run - we were up much earlier, but it took a while to figure out where to go and how to get there.</p>

<p>So Les Plans has a little 5k loop that takes you to the edge of the valley and back - it crosses a little mountain stream and goes through the woods.</p>

<p>And then you pull around and come back on the other side.</p>

<p>We were finishing our first loop when I saw something going on out of the corner of my eye. I stopped skiing, because I knew something was up. Just as stopped, looking to my right, I saw two beady eyes and a little mouse-looking creature with snow-white fur who was poking his head out of the snow, like a little submarine telescope. Luckily, Lavinia wasn't too far ahead, and I was able to get her to stop and look just as 'the Duke' stood up and gave us another look. This time he looked at us for a few seconds, and cocked his head a little like he was sizing us up. I think I said 'Hey little guy!', and then he was gone.</p>

<p>I wasn't able to get the camera fast enough, but this is a stock photo of a fouine -</p>

<p>We don't have them in the US, but in Britain they call them 'stone martens'. We took that to be a sign of good luck, because they don't interact with people much at all. Later that day, when were having lunch nearby, I asked the waitress about it.</p>

<p>They had a stuffed marmotte on the wall, which is basically a european squirrel, and I pointed to it and said - in French of course - 'we just got back from skiing, and we saw something sort of like that, but smaller, all in white...' - and she interrupted me. It was probably a fouine, she said. In the winter, their coats change to match the snow. Fascinating.</p>

<p>I have not been able to find a picture of a fouine with it's winter coat - so I imagine it is a pretty rare sighting. It really made our day, and felt like a sign that Le Grand Bornand was indeed a magical place. We hope to get back there soon.</p>

<p>UPDATE: I found a picture of a white 'hermine', which I don't think is exactly the same animal but clearly a close cousin. Our little guy was smaller, and his eyes seemed to be more red around the edges.</p>
