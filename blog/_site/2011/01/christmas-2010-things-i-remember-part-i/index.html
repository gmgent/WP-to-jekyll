<br />
<p>We had an amazing time.</p><br />
<br />
<br />
<p>I wanted to write some stuff down while it&#8217;s still fresh. I have long written for slightly figurative audiences &#8211; I have had a few different sites, and few different blogs, and always pulled them down eventually either as the march of progress or for lack of enduring desire to continue.</p><br />
<br />
<br />
<p>These writings, finally, are only for me and possibly future members of the Axel clan, and that&#8217;s about it. So I don&#8217;t have to feel any pressure. I stopped reading, and eventually stopped writing, for quite a spell through my late 20&#8242;s and early 30&#8242;s, I think largely due to general feelings of inadequacy and specific feelings of angst, but as I grow older I see the power of time more clearly and I am more proud every day of who I am. I have an amazing wife, a soon-to-arrive puppy, and a great future so I want to start again with what amounts to a personal diary.</p><br />

<p>There are a few main things I remember from this trip, I will try to write about them all. The first thing that comes to mind is the day-trip we took to Geneva, and although Geneva was gorgeous, what I remember most was the view of the Alps coming over the pass from the Jura valley and the great conversations I had with the cab drivers that took us there and back. It felt great to really dig in with my conversational French, and specifically on the way there I really got along with the cabbie. One funny note &#8211; in France, or at least in Jura, taxi drivers assume that the first person will sit in the front. It is very common for them to have stuff in the back seat, so two people taking a cab together will often get split up, one in front and one in back, which seems strange to an American. I was slightly hesitant but it turned out great because we were able to talk the whole way there, which is easily a 45 minute ride. As I think about it, there was a lady who drove us to Geneva and picked us up, but the guy I am talking about actually drove us to Le Grand Bornand from Les Rousses, which is more like a 90 minute ride. No wonder I feel like we got along so well &#8211; we spoke more or less non-stop for way over an hour. </p><br />
<br />
<br />
<p>I won&#8217;t get into all the things we talked about, but there are two that come to mind. First was when he asked me about gang violence in Los Angeles. I made a joke and said that yes, there are some bad neighborhoods, but they are mostly south and east of the main city hub, and if any funky cholos or gangbangers decided to come and mess with us in Hollywood, they would probably get stuck in traffic and end up turning around to go home. The point I was making was that L.A. is huge and has a lot of different stuff going on. He thought about that and mentioned that Lyon is like that, or at least certain regions around there, so I took a mental note. Apparently, they also have some amazing restaurants and I almost took us there for a day or two over this trip (we opted for Besançon instead) so that felt a bit like I dodged a bullet. Anyway, he also made a very shrewd point &#8211; which was oddly prescient &#8211; that the difference between France and the US is simply that in France, it&#8217;s mostly just the cops who have guns, and in the US anyone can get their hands on one. He went on to say that it&#8217;s a very effective policy because gangs can only be so bad as long as they are not armed to the teeth. Of course, we got home and in less than a week we had that horrible shooting of <a title="Gabrielle Giffords" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabrielle_Giffords" target="_blank">Gabrielle Giffords</a> and he could not have been more right. Not that gangs were involved per se, but it was clearly a problem with unfettered access to guns by people who should not have ANY access to guns &#8211; in this case a guy with a well documented history of mental illness.</p><br />
<br />
<br />
<p>On a less somber note, one of the other things we talked about was Switzerland, which was very interesting. He asked us about our day trip to Geneva the day prior &#8211; there is really only one cab company that serves the Jura region, and he was apparently the boss, so he must have known about our whole schedule. I answered that everything was closed, and he said of course, they are very devout Christians over there (it was a Sunday). I had no idea. Our trip was fun, but all the shops were closed, and now I know why. It turned out to be a blessing, because we probably would have spent a lot more money had the shops been open. There looks to be very good shopping in Geneva although it is quite a pricey town. So we ended up on a bit of a odyssey, basically just looking for places to go that weren&#8217;t closed. We did a lot of walking, as usual. We visited the St. Pierre Cathedral, which was beautiful, and learned about Geneva&#8217;s role in the <a title="protestant reformation" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_Reformation" target="_blank">Protestant Reformation</a> (fascinating). We also saw Calvin&#8217;s chair, which I loved because I have a thing for relics &#8211; inorganic ones, to be sure. Old bones kind of freak me out. Anyway, we ended up at the museum of Archeology, which was more or less a children&#8217;s museum, but was still sort of fun. It was pretty cold that day, definitely a hat scarf and gloves kind of affair, and when we got there we were surprised to learn that entry was free and that the coat room was out in the open, completely unmonitored, and that we were expected to just leave our stuff there. We thought about it for a second, but we really wanted to pull all of our layers off, and so with a &#8216;when in Rome&#8217; attitude we followed suit. An hour or so later, we were happy to see that our stuff was still where we left it.</p><br />
<br />
<br />
<p>So I mentioned this to the taxi driver, and he laughed. He said yup, they still work on the honor system in Switzerland. The entire society is very honest and collectively they enjoy a sort of regulated state utopia. They have somehow managed to build in some ways an ideal society. He mentioned that they still sell newspapers on the honor system &#8211; there is a box full of papers, which you just open and pull out a copy and they trust you to then put the right amount of coins in the strongbox. I remember him saying &#8211; &#8220;et si c&#8217;etait en France, dans 5 minutes, il n&#8217;y aura rien, et dans la boite, pas un sou&#8230;&#8221;</p><br />
<br />
<br />
<p>So Switzerland really is an anomaly.</p><br />
