<p>I'm the guy who doesn't know when to stop, or how to remove myself from the subject. I am always in character. It's all personal. Or I am looking past it, or to the side... My moments are genuine, and I respect the art of casual conversation, but I'm always looking for clues that hint to something bigger. Oh, so you're excited about THIS, what does that mean - why does that matter? Why am I listening? Which misses the point... I am a part of something, maybe just a moment between two people - and things progress naturally, that's a fact. But for some reason, I want to see a promise; I want flame, and madness. Or else I will improvise conceptually, I will wrap my own silence around the setting like an army of candles and peer across exaggerated distances. I will leave the room and come back, watching in slow motion as the exchanges of energy become fireworks... And not contribute a word. It is a tax I enforce. And just before it becomes obvious that I have been silent for some spell, I mention something trivial, as if my mind had been somewhere else... When, in fact, I have just been intensely aware of other-than-self. I have been in awe of the magic between humans.
And I see perhaps the alternate facts... The may-have-beens, the sad longings, and the silent understandings. The emotional contracts, and the web of possibles. So I surprise myself, and mesmerized by my own lack of impulse I form opinions, lingering forever in the middle. Somehow I admire the carriers of interest, the lines of thought through chaos that charge ahead with will, but I often see my peers, my friends, stumbling over the same things, as if they were in some mental darkness. It seems obvious to me that the path I seek has not yet been found, and that all comparison should defer to the future. I can only learn what not to do.
It occurs to me that my original tenets still hold true, most importantly the one that says 'true talent will always find it's way'; if I continue to distinguish myself from others, and build on the foundations that I have assembled there will never be a question of whether or not I was talkative enough. That seems absurd. I will always hold that one can only be so wise as to know oneself, and that is sufficient. Why would we seek to change our impulses without first knowing what they are? And that task itself needs a lifetime. I have been plagued and weakened by some doubt about my own personality, the energy I should offer so willingly to all that wish to see but it does not come naturally to me to be so consistent. I guess that's acting - feigned consistency. When I decide to act, I want it to be in a Hollywood class for beginners, not at a social audition. I still want honesty. I want to be recognized, not trivialized. I don't know what that means...
Except that I'm surprised how everyone finds a way to fit - even though most of it is for show. Even though so much discord lies just beneath the surface, like cockroaches, I still am amazed at how most of it is so pretty, this enormous pretension. We all live our lives with so little, such a limited view, such a narrow approach; and pleasure is so fleeting - hunger so complete, so consuming. Luck is a bad friend. Love doesn't always stay.
And then I am lost in a crowd of intentions.</p>

<p>And then I grow tired.</p>
