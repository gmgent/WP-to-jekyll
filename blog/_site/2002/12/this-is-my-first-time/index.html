                This is my first time
            </h2>
			<p class="teaser_info"><p>Wednesday, December 04, 2002</p><br />
<br />
<p>This is my first time.</p><br />
<br />
<p>It's like coming back after a long journey.</p><br />
<br />
<p>I am committed to bringing back the prose in my life. I remember having thought many times before, god, if only I could make the time to get used to writing a lot, often. There's so much I would say... I feel like I've had so much free time that gets wasted. I may be one of the most productive individuals in this universe, but of course by my own standards, there is so much left to accomplish. Maybe it's just the reformed slackers that later in life become so awkwardly motivated. It's like I'm still learning to walk.<br />
But it does occur to me that so much in life that is reproachable stems from apathy, from inaction. I don't ever want to feel party to that. So maybe that's all that is important - caring. About anything... maybe this is just passion I feel, straight up like a shot of whiskey. Everything, in the end, has to do with whiskey.<br />
I have known for some time now, that I have an addictive mind. I remember having said that if one is good, two is better... and so on. Of course I was talking about women - not necessarily group sex, I think it was in reference to giving gifts; but the premise is the same. I feel that, deep in my bones - the need to multiply what I love.<br />
And now I am empowered. I have the tools, this new computer, and the world stretches out now like a long road waiting to be traveled. The people I see, the grails I chase and the bullets shooting past me are all short stories developing themselves. Every voice I've ever heard, and every decision I didn't make fast enough are now available for revisiting, for extension. I can imagine things I never did, and put words in anyone's mouth. I can give all of my pain justification.<br />
Why is it that I only want to document the most cerebral chapter in the history of humanity that has somehow found itself fallen into a blonde cliche? Even as the majority of world citizens struggle with destiny itself, or at best let go completely of the sciences that have built their world, the sharp edge of innovation refines the human sphere to oligarchic orgasm. Am I not to stand in awe, pen ready? I wish to understand, to empathize towards the synthesis of a new emotion: awareness, the sterilized cocaine. A luxury.<br />
To what end? As every writer follows a hidden signal... I want some rung in the ladder of human consciousness to be my namesake, nothing less. On this cold night, in the lap of lost memories with a view over the landscapes of destiny - in Los Angeles, on a street still thick with the air of decay my fate begins.</p><br />
<br />
<p>With short steps and long thought have I risen, and the moment approaches to accelerate. I have learned from others only what not to attempt. My ideas remain pure, as the dilution that comes from popularity has not surfaced. I give thanks often for my gifts of music, both given and received. The fruits of my retrospection have been simple affirmations. If destiny is not my friend then surely I am my own benefactor. I was ashamed to admit the extent of my compensation today... Among my own friends, I am often a stranger, of my own retreat. I will return in time.<br />
Because there are no contemporaries for me. I have been dealt some ancient joker, and the value is uncertain but the prospect is good. I have been, for a long time now since a dark evening by the lake in Madison that I remember, rich in self-assurance. It is a warm wind that touches me sometimes and I follow it always. I am alone sometimes because of it, and I am not without my own serpents but the light is always visible. Even at night, when I am visited by doubt. I am not afraid of the silence.<br />
Here is the course of the day, and the moments of exhaustion, and the flames of addiction. The pensive perch, and the mental engine. The gears of logic. The cloud of ennui, and the certainty that comes with a healthy bank account. It's all mine, the knowledge, the magic, the language and science of code that gives me such power. I found it all like a hunter and a thinker, with study and contemplation, and with a fair amount of deceit. I can see now how the past may be reconstructed for the greater good. I will make the world glad for its trust.</p><br />
<br />
<p>thank you</p><br />
