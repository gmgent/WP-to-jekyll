<br />3:19 minutes (3.05 MB)<p>It was all for you
The long expensive road to nothing new
These unappreciated lines for you
Falling on this tough love crowd, it’s true
I did it all for you
Open arms
There’s nothing better than those ample charms
Somewhere waiting for the world to start
Somehow afflicted by a broken heart
Looking for those open arms
When I was a prince of the world
All I had was a long list of words
All I saw I could touch with my hands
All I needed was
All I needed was a chance
Those days are gone
I think I see your yesterdays moved on
They left behind that dirty smile you’ve got
Younger than your timeless ways
Your yesterdays
I know all your tricks
I know the way your heart can hurt like this
I hate the way my plan can miss like this
But there’s no changing what my future is
I know all your tricks
When I was ahead of it all
And I could see what was coming along
Everybody knew the way to get home, but me
All I needed was
All I needed was a dream</p>
