<blockquote>
NOTE: Rachel is still a friend of mine, but we are not really in touch at all. For a brief period from 2003-2004, we wrote poems to each other as a sort of literary love affair. Nothing ever became physical which is just as well. Many of the poems that I wrote in that period were spawned in the creative energy that was flowing during that time.

Rachel
Your name stops time dead
In it's tracks I know what it's like to be
Alone with human frailty
October like a bruise on your chin
I summon the specter of poetry 
The phoenix
Burning
Born with an arrow in its wings
This is the path
And you have not risen
Yet. All is torn
From conflict and happiness
Hurts, it makes no pattern
You give life to the rain
So it might come back with 
Answers attached
Waiting for love
As if you didn't know where to look.

We stumble through the future
Some of us with magic
In our fingertips
Some with bitter dust
On cracked lips
Everywhere this motion
Blind speed
Rinse 
Repeat
Rinse 
Repeat
