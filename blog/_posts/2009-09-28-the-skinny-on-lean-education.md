<p>Very interesting - quoted from <a href="http://esciencenews.com/articles/2009/09/28/the.skinny.lean.education" title="http://esciencenews.com/articles/2009/09/28/the.skinny.lean.education">http://esciencenews.com/articles/2009/09/28/the.skinny.lean.education</a> :</p>
<p>There are several key principles of Lean thinking that can be adapted to adult education and online learning, Alagaraja explains:</p>
<p>    * Cellular processes: allow chunking of coursework so that it can be taught as valid, standalone sub-units of a complete whole.<br />
    * Policy deployment: is a strategic planning process that correlates the purpose of a course with objectives and activities.<br />
    * Flow: encourages learner ownership so that they can dwell on a topic or move along more swiftly depending on their understanding.<br />
    * Just-in-time: provides feedback on projects in time for discussion in next class session/meeting.<br />
    * "Kaizen": Allows educators to adapt the course to learner feedback.<br />
    * "Kanban": Offers learners timely feedback on their mistakes so that they can correct their understanding quickly and effectively.<br />
    * "Poka-yoke": Is mistake proofing, which involves standardizing the syllabus to prevent recurrent problems.<br />
    * "Quality function deployment": Incorporates learner needs into the design and updating of the course content.<br />
    * Standardization: Simplifies assignments to meet learner requirements.<br />
    * Theory of constraints: Identifies barriers, such as technological limitations, and removes them.<br />
    * Throughput: Designs assignments with real-life relevance.<br />
    * Value stream mapping, visual controls, and visual management: Provides a map of the course flow.<br />
    * Waste elimination: Eliminates extraneous material. </p>
<p>Today's adult learning environment emphasizes technology, but beyond the rhetoric of customizing education around learners' needs, the concept of Lean Thinking has the potential to improve learning, reduce time wasted, and make adult and online courses truly applicable to real life beyond the virtual school halls.</p>
