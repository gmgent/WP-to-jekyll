I thought I had this info somewhere, but I guess I don't. Lavinia beat me by about 14 minutes but to be fair she trained and I didn't. Also, the times listed are raw (no offset) and actually we didn't cross the start line until about minute 16. So Lavinia's time was just over 5:38 and I was around 5:52.


We both ran the <a href="http://www.honolulumarathon.org/" target="_blank">Honolulu marathon</a> just before Christmas in 2008.
