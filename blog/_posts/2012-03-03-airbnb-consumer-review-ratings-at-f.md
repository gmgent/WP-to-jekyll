You should always check ratings before you book with someone new. As it turns out AIRBNB has a horrible track record. I think service is so important and I saw the signs from the beginning. Service was so lazy and unresponsive from the start so that later they could just do nothing because they didn't see anything. Buyer beware.

<strong>Airbnb</strong> consumer review rating of <strong>F</strong>.
