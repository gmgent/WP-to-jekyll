<p>This would be a pivot query 101 kind of snippet. They teach this in SQL kindergarten - I only imagine, of course, because I never went. </p>
<p>The use case: it&#039;s a single table, with values grouped by partner_id and two enums for revplan_type. You need a variance report. What do you do?</p>
