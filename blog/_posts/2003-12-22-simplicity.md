<p>As I pass through this ritual<br />
the solemn jest of circumstance<br />
what lies beneath the scattered chorus<br />
of beautiful lies is only<br />
simple. As if this grand blaspheme<br />
echoes with vast precision<br />
as a caricature of the unknown<br />
in the veins of all creatures<br />
blind to the engine of desire</p>
<p>The solitude does not resist<br />
it summons age with boundless gravity<br />
these foreign lifetimes on a hidden shelf<br />
aligned with sharp intuition<br />
and the softest touch of<br />
simplicity. The radius<br />
of joined hands across the future<br />
imagined like a day in December<br />
imagines the hot summer moon</p>
<p>I wait with this painful thirst<br />
spilling my own secrets among the threads<br />
of wisdom. With heat from this friction<br />
from this collision of dead stars<br />
to guide my drugged senses this is no<br />
simple sacrifice. I belong to these fragments<br />
of a martyr and his cause<br />
a symphony in passing cars<br />
survival and the art of breathing</p>
