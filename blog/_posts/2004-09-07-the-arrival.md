Strong words like big rocks
Leaning against each other this
Garden of giants
You came ashore like an eclipse
And blinded us all. In 
The shape of a promise
The wings of a summer day
Spread their feathers across the sky
It was like magic, unpolished
From some ancient place
And it didn't rain
As if the clouds couldn't speak
The illusion of innocence
But the heart knows better
Cold to the touch, yet
Hot like a black stove
In the sun
