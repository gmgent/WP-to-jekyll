<br />3:20 minutes (4.57 MB)<p>An old recording from a really long time ago, done on a Fostex 4-track cassette. This was a re-recording and substantial retooling of the original version written as a junior in high school in 1989. The title was taken from a Langston Hughes poem called &#039;Strange Hurt&#039;.</p>
<p>Krister Axel - acoustic guitar, vocals, Korg CX-3</p>
