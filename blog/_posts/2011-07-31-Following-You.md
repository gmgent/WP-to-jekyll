when all hands are tied with other things
and we turn the wheel that future brings
there's no way to see before it folds
so we trust the things we learn to do
all my love
is following you
all my love
is following you
following you
following you

the summer comes too fast again
we can never slow the speed of anything
so we lead with what we have to give
and hope to make some sense of it

i walk beside you
i walk beside you
and my heart is following you
my heart is following you
all my love
following you


following you
