<p>It has been so long since I wrote a blog post.</p>
<p>I used to fill up a whole book per year with  poems and lyrics and such but then when I was in college they invented this thing called the personal computer and I ended up staying in the library all night to use my first email address. And then I bought my own computer. Then I got a laptop.</p>
<p>Now I am sending tweets from my phone that auto post to Facebook and my own website. Soon I will have it so I can email in posts from anywhere. Somewhere along the line I stopped blogging as much, because like mostly every songwriter/geek right now I have a bunch of social profiles to keep updating and it's not as much about writing anymore as it is about <em>connecting</em> what you write. Yikes.</p>
<p>Anyway, I have a gig coming up finally. I think my last one was in November. I sent out an email recently (<a href="http://campaign-archive.com/?u=29744d054bf577181511e20e9&amp;id=c1510a0736" target="_blank">link</a>), and I'm shuffling around my web sites like it's going out of style. I'm still looking to possibly move Ruby hosts, I have done pretty well so far with the ghetto-ish <a href="http://railsplayground.com/" target="_blank">RailsPlayground</a> but I will need to upgrade soon. Other than that, I am dropping both NamesDirect and Hostmonster for a fully centralized account at Dreamhost, and so far I'm pretty happy with it. Dreamhost does leave you out in the cold a little on the support side, but that's why I've been contracting out a little php work lately and it's been working pretty well. Php labor is pretty cheap these days, and I pay my guys well (no matter what they do - from php devs all the way up to studio cats that I bring in for my album projects) so it is all working out famously.</p>
<p>And of course, my peeps at <a href="http://gmg-entertainment.com" target="_blank">GMG</a> are taking good care of me. I got a wedding coming up, dontcha know.</p>
