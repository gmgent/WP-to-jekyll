<p>Download your preferred MYSQL version from the community download site. If you're on Snow Leopard, you may want to install the 64-bit version.</p>
<p>Install mysql via dmg or compile it from source.</p>
<p>Type â€˜which mysql_config' on the terminal to locate said config. Take note of this location as we'll use it on the next step.</p>
<p>Install the mysql gem with the command below. If the location for your mysql config is different with the one below, use that instead.</p>
<pre>
sudo env ARCHFLAGS="-Os -arch x86_64 -fno-common" \
gem install mysql -- --with-mysql-config=/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql_config
</pre><p>
worked for me!</p>
