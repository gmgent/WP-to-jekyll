I have been pretty hard at work curating all of my old pictures and blog posts. The good news is that this is almost done. I went through all of my old hard drives and collected the missing pictures and I now have a pretty sweet set of blog posts stretching back through the ages. It makes me both happy and sad that when I started blogging we didn't really have RSS feeds, and although I've lost a few pictures here and there most of them have made it all the way here - pictures hosted on Google/Picasa which one hopes won't be going anywhere in the next few years, and web hosting by Rackspace. Times have changed - this is a new decade, and let's hope we don't continue the political downward spiral that we have since the Clinton years. You can read all about my outrage through the two Bush presidencies starting at around page 2 of my <a href="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/topics/archive/page/2/">historical</a> archives.
