<p>All tied up<br />
Nowhere left to go but down<br />
Turn your world around<br />
Burning down the house<br />
when everything goes south<br />
Change your state<br />
Find a place to go away<br />
Try to love again<br />
Choice is not a sin<br />
Try to let me in</p>
<p>I know you're hurt<br />
I know you're hurt</p>
<p>We take what's good and we take what's right<br />
We break our toys and don't think twice<br />
We hold our breath and we don't know why<br />
Now it's over<br />
it's over<br />
has it changed so much since the day we were born?<br />
Because I feel so much is all but gone<br />
So I hold my breath and I don't look back<br />
Now it's over<br />
it's over<br />
it's over now</p>
<p>All tied up<br />
Something in my head won't budge<br />
I'm changing all my ways<br />
Counting up the days<br />
The ones we didn't hate<br />
It's over now<br />
And so we say again<br />
You're out and someone else is in<br />
We don't know where they've been<br />
But choice is not a sin</p>
