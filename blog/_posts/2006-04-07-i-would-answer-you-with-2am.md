<p>I would answer you with 2am<br />
With opinions about my state<br />
Staying up late</p>
<p>I don't know where I am<br />
This voice beneath the hum<br />
I spend my nights alone with words<br />
The echo of a drum<br />
I love the way we talk<br />
This language of the soul</p>
<p>I want to thank you for saying my name</p>
<p>Some thirst for perfection<br />
guides my days. Like noise<br />
in long breaths of scented smoke<br />
the poison of poetic lust<br />
grows in my blood like a weed<br />
I accept this. Every hour<br />
Pushing with what strength I have<br />
Against yesterday</p>
<p>Where once was a child is now<br />
A fool. He follows heat<br />
And questions what is fire<br />
I am this champion of doubt<br />
Against what can't be named<br />
I accept this. With my words<br />
Construction of simple color<br />
The unknown voice</p>
<p>Never seen. Decides what is real</p>
<p>And the sad eyes of exhaustion<br />
ever wise. In this life will be</p>
