<br />4:44 minutes (4.34 MB)<p>A decent version with the amazing Judy Ruden on harmonica. This was right when I started playing <em>Holland Park Road</em> on guitar in open D (with the capo), instead of on keys like I had been. Performed live at the Stone, summer 2006.</p>
<p>Krister Axel - acoustic guitar, vocals<br />
Carson Cohen - bass<br />
Karen Teperberg - drums<br />
Mike Freas - guitar<br />
Judy Ruden - harmonica</p>
