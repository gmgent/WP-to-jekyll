<p>There is so much slang out there, I love it. I eat this stuff up. From the same demographic that brought you 'pwning', I give you:</p>
<p>RAWR - (to scream)</p>
<p>as in:</p>
<p><i>Nevertheless I will survive. And throwing lots of tantrums. And rawring. And ice creamingâ€¦</i></p>
<p><i>...perhaps you can specify which you meant before RAWRing at each other.</i></p>
<p><i>...metal and screaming/rawring plz can u give me sum pointers on how to do it better?</i></p>
<p><small>above quotes pulled randomly from google</small></p>
<p>Basically, it's sort of a respelling of 'Roaring' except it seems to have a bit of a 'griping' connotation. As in, screaming for the purposes of expressing dissatisfaction.</p>
