<p>So here we are, a year out from when Sivers sold CDBaby to Discmakers. The whole thing has gone to shyte. The links don't work, my albums are showing up randomly and inconsistently across different digital networks.</p>
<p>All of my options are locked now, meaning nothing can change. Horrible. I guess all good things go away eventually. CD Baby used to be really the best ever. Now, they totally suck.</p>
<p>It is possible that if you are a new client it works fine, but I have 4 albums distributed with them and the user experience for me went from from A+ to a D-. So sad.</p>
<p>Oh Derek - why did you abandon us?</p>
<p>Discmakers sucks. Bring back the old CD Baby. Please. I have had so many problems already! Does anyone know an easy way to port my whole CD Baby catalog to somewhere else?</p>
