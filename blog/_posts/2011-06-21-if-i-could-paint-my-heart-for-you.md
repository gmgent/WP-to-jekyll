<blockquote>copied from a book of mine in the long ago:</blockquote>


if I could paint my heart for you right now
the colors would blind us both
 I am in mid-explosion and I can't help it
 afraid to push open the door to this new understanding 
Only now do I realize how far I have wandered
 what it will take to bring me back

  I am glad for you, such a beautiful image
 of young and deliberate passion
 time has not allowed you much failure 
that cleansing fire of regret
 your heart is as big as any canyon
 even as my feet begin to slip

if I could paint my heart for you
 an empty shell is all you would see
 Choosing from among these pretty cages
 I find strength because you are still so free
 I am in mid-explosion and I can't help it
 you are a flower blooming patiently
