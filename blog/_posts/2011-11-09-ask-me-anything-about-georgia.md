Klout seems to think I am influential on the topic of Georgia. I think that's funny.

Yes, I have a song called Georgia Rain that has been successful lately but that hardly makes me a topic influencer. You be the judge. Maybe this song <em>is</em> a hit in Georgia.

<blockquote><small>trivia: This is one of the only songs in the Axel catalog where I am playing what amounts to lead electric guitar. I had that guitar custom made for me in Madison in the summer of 1996. It is a strat body with a Nuno Bettencourt neck by <em>Washburn</em>, lol. Ash body and maple neck, I think. It is my only true left-handed instrument (with a right-handed bridge). My acoustic is just a regular guitar that I play flipped over.</small></blockquote>
