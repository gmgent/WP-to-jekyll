I wrote this for my senior Poetry thesis in college quite some time ago. I am happy to have found it, and I have my mother to thank for that. She keeps everything!

This is a 'Canzone', which is a very strict rhyme scheme of five 12-line stanzas, and a closer stanza of 5 lines for a total of 65 lines across 6 stanzas. Every line ends with one of 5 words that you choose very carefully. I took my five from a snippet by my favorite poet <strong>e.e. cummings</strong>.

<em>Mademoiselle de la Dance</em>

<em>some or if where
shall breath a new
(silverly rare
goldenly so)
moon,she is you

	- e. e. cummings</em>
</pre>
<pre>
as if we stood nowhere,
time shall breathe
a spell: where
still happens quickly where
thoughts are so rare
and I don't know where
I put me, once where
everything is, somehow so
curious, quiet was (so)
the place where
I met you:
you

were a red falling leaf, you
had veins where
blood boils, hot you
were red you
wouldn't let me breathe
and I had you
dancing, dreaming you
are so beautiful and rare
it is rare
that I dance but with you
dancing is so
easy, I like it so

like a mad waltz... yet so
simple and you -
if love is fast, so
are you (the bullet) and so
am I (the flesh) where
pain can be so
painless, so
blood-happy I breathe
in, I live and breathe
still: so
I am not un-living, which is rare;
quite rare

when life is rare -
why is this so?
if life is rare
then you (rare,
precious you)
are as the white doe: rare
like a soft stone is rare
I want to trace with two fingers where
the air meets your skin, where
the smooth, rare
curve of your throat (your breath)
purrs - you breathe

and the oceans breathe;
a dried-up wave is not as rare
as you my stare crashes breath-
lessly against you, my breath
sits waiting so
quietly... a secret, stolen breath
waiting to breathe
I cannot but wish of you
want of you
waiting to breathe,
in a world where
time stopped counting where

you lead me everywhere
as you have hidden my breath
somewhere: a beauty of skill quite rare
(and seldomly so),
mademoiselle have you
