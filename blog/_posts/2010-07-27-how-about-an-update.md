<p>Well, here I am finally writing an actual blog update. I've been tweeting a lot, and posting code/geek stuff on <a href="http://codeboxer.com" target="_blank">codeboxer.com</a>, but not a lot of personal updates. I'm still preparing to release some new music, but I don't have an album cover yet. I am completely out of touch with almost everyone I know, due to a pretty long string of bad phone experiences (theft, not working, etc.) and some tough times at work that leave me feeling a little too angry about the world to reach out at all. But that seems to be changing, bit by bit. Of course I am still completely enamored with my beautiful wife and next year sometime we are going to start a family, so there is a lot to look forward to.</p>
<p>I have been slinging database code for 10 years now, and Ruby on Rails for over 3. What a life this has been so far. In a horrible economy, I managed to pick a career that is still woefully short on good talent and I am very grateful for that.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, I start working from home which is basically a dream come true.</p>
<p>I know I have been slacking a little in terms of releasing music, but I still have some new tracks available<a href="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/2010/04/on-sale-now-at-emusic-amazon-and-rhapsody/"  target="_blank"><here</a> that are new and most of y'all haven't heard.</here</a></a></p>
<p>I am also really excited about 'Pain &amp; Joy', which will be my newest release once I can get someone to do an awesome album cover for me.</p>
<p>Finally, you can hear a sneak preview from the upcoming release at my podcast - <a href="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/RockStarAlley/"  target="_blank">here</a> .</p>
<p>later!</p>
