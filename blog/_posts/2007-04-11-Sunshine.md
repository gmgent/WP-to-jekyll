<br />3:37 minutes (4.97 MB)<p>Adam Marcello - drums<br />
Brandon Krueger - bass, guitar<br />
Krister Axel - piano, Wurlitzer, vocals</p>
<p>from the EP release iMTHEGUN (2006)</p>
<p>you started out a face in the street<br />
looking for a sweet kind of stranger<br />
to come by and set you up in style<br />
now you know the way to fit in<br />
to place your bets and win<br />
how to keep your secrets safe</p>
<p>hey sunshine it&#039;s been a long time</p>
