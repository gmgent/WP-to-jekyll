whoever is the first to seize it
is who ever gets a chance to shine
and fly above the souls that made them
steal their hearts and drink their wine
you don't want to be
the last one on
you don't want to be
the last one
they'd never want you at all
now it's time for getting better
now is the time for making bread
oh you never see the sunlight
oh it's such a shape we're in
you don't want to be
the last one on
you don't want to be
the last one
they'd never want you at all
I don't have the strength to stand here
if I can't have my games to play
don't you make me tell my story
I don't know what I would say
they'd never want me at all
