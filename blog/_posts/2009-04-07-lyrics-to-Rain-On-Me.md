<p>When I was old enough to dance<br />
when I was high enough to see<br />
anywhere the sky is dark<br />
it rains on me</p>
<p>and I race<br />
just to fall<br />
just to be where you are </p>
<p>all we are is all we are<br />
what we learn is what we teach<br />
anywhere the sky is dark<br />
it rains on me</p>
<p>and I race<br />
just to fall<br />
just to be where you are<br />
I race<br />
if there&#039;s nothing in this world<br />
you put something in the dirt<br />
and rain on me</p>
<p>it don&#039;t matter what you do<br />
it don&#039;t matter what you eat<br />
if you don&#039;t know the truth<br />
you won&#039;t be free</p>
<p>don&#039;t wait<br />
don&#039;t wait for me<br />
I race<br />
if there&#039;s nothing in this world<br />
you put something in the dirt<br />
and rain on me</p>
<p><small>from the album Fast Train (2008)</small></p>
