<p>I write with obscene distractions<br />
Collapsing myth and desire<br />
Into fiction. This false mirror<br />
The distance effect<br />
Bring me to the center<br />
Of careless reflection<br />
I am caged within myself<br />
Eager to touch the outside<br />
To re-imagine this contest<br />
Of machines in some new circle<br />
The human satellites<br />
The race of love against momentum<br />
My own skin warm from the memory<br />
Of union. Let no one seek<br />
To cover this unborn flower<br />
Cradled in the soft earth<br />
I dream this without madness<br />
Leaned against the echoing wall<br />
Where a whisper is united<br />
With power and substance<br />
Kings of modern freedom<br />
These messengers shall be</p>
