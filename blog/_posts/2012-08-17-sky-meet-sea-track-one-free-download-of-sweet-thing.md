Sweet Thing


I was the revolution 
you were the liberation 
that falls from a pregnant sky 
set loose on a Friday night 
I know what you do to me 
you give love in these little pieces 
saving for a rainy day 
I think you should give it away 

Sweet thing, sweet thing 
all you get is nothing 
sweet thing, sweet thing 
all you get is nothing when you put nothing in 

she's high on the running away 
here tonight and gone the next day 
sweet like a candy girl 
lasts as long as a dirty word 
soft like a butterfly 
hot like a brushfire 
don't make me fall in love 
if you don't want to be the one 

Sweet thing, sweet thing 
all you get is nothing 

Yeah, yeah and you're feeling so much better 
you're feeling so much better 
Yeah, yeah and you're feeling so much better 
you're feeling so much better 

Sweet thing, sweet thing 
all you get is nothing 
sweet thing, sweet thing 
all you get is nothing when you put nothing in
