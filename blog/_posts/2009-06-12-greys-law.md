<p>Grey's Law posits </p>
<p><strong><br />
"Any sufficiently advanced incompetence is indistinguishable from malice."</strong></p>
<p>which probably imitates Clarke's Third Law. Arthur C. Clarke formulated the following three "laws" of prediction:</p>
<p>   1. When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.<br />
   2. The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible.<br />
   3. Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.</p>
