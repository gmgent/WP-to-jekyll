this road that I have walked on all these years
does not exist. As if
the struggle was against nothing
shadows and easy promises
empty air and reflections
but no road to walk on.

this window I have stared through
for a full season of my life
has no purpose. There is nothing to see
on the other side, only
more of the same. It is not 
as I imagined.

the only feeling I have
is that of drifting. Along
some corridor in my mind
that leads into soft madness
like a cloud of cotton
behind my nose
