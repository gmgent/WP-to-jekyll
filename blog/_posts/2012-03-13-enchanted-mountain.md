We really can't say enough good things about this breeder. Everyone should consider adopting a rescue dog. But for those who are looking for a responsible breeder of Shih Tzus, especially the imperial size of our little Mooshoo, you should look up <a href="http://www.enchantedmountainshihtzu.com/" target="_blank">Rael</a>. She is great.

And look at the gorgeous little girl that we picked up at the LAX cargo center in February of last year. She has changed our lives.
