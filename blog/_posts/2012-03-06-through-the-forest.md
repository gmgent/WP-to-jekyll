through the forest

<a href="http://kristeraxel.com/media/vault/ttf2.mp3">link</a>

i found my legs while running circles in
the temple of the flesh
turning corners in heavy traffic while
the cruise control is set
smiling faces and hiding places
a happy hour somewhere
I remember falling backwards
and losing all my hair

I remember

I see pictures twenty years from now
the weight of it on our skin
50 percent love and hatred
the rest falling in between
live and let live give and get gifts
keep something for yourself
I've been down some but I always made it up
to you and all my friends

I remember

bringing my girl coffee in bed
crashing my car and breaking my leg
being so blind but still
getting through the forest to you

through the forest
through the forest

such a daybreak like I've never seen
if only because I saw it rise
from the ashes of Las Vegas
like paint reaching for the sky
live and let live give and get gifts
invite me back this time
you're so restless, a caged up tigress
with earthquakes on your mind

I remember

bringing my girl coffee in bed
crashing my car and breaking my leg
being so blind but still getting through
being so blind but still getting through
being so blind but still getting through
the forest
through the forest
through the forest
