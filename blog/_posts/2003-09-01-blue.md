<p>How do I create myself every day?<br />
Without shadow and eclipse<br />
In small motions, followed<br />
Through these cracks<br />
As the foundations grow weak<br />
Like tired children<br />
Blue is the color of hope<br />
Washing her blue hair<br />
In blue water</p>
<p>If you are lost then follow choice<br />
Through the forest of change<br />
No longer afraid of understanding<br />
Yourself. Of all gifts<br />
You are life, splendid and frail<br />
Dressed in the friendship of strangers<br />
Without the burden of time<br />
Alone by the river<br />
Of blue water</p>
