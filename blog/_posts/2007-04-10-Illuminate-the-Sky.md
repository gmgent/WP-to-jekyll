<br />3:52 minutes (4.42 MB)<p>notes: standard tuning, capo 2nd fret, verse lives around small chord G formation up two frets - i.e., B chord. Chorus moves to E.</p>
<p>A slight jazz feel, fast tempo yet laid back. Gorgeous French horn / trombone arrangement. Featured on the soundtrack to &#039;A Colombia&#039; by Ryan Byrne, this is still one of my personal favorites.</p>
<p>Mark Corben on bass<br />
Bill Dowling did the horn charts</p>
