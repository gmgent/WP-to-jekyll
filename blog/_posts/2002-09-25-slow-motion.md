<p>Life in slow motion.<br />
I always made mistakes<br />
Forgive me. Truth be told<br />
I have been weak for some time<br />
But you know this. We believed each other<br />
And it was beautiful<br />
Until the weight of my own darkness<br />
Touched your shoulder. Silence<br />
For me is passion<br />
Passion for me is<br />
When you come<br />
I wish a thousand blessings on you<br />
For not hesitating<br />
For bringing me closer<br />
All I have to offer<br />
Are the moments not<br />
Forgotten. I am empty<br />
As I was. Drowning<br />
like a dumb puppy. </p>
<p>I don't know how to be touched</p>
<p>Forgive me.</p>

Temporary

So he said he runs away even from the good things
Well now, I run full force ahead into them
Knocking them down with my brashness
When they eventually recover from their temporary
concussions
They look at me and say- who are you? and how did
you get here?

I think you will say that eventually 
I came at you like a man
But now I want to be a girl
She said you have to stay the same
I can't change
Oh horrid consistency

You are a good thing, I think
But I don't know if I am blinded by your chords
Or that feeling of wanting to covet or possess the
truth you harmonize
Do I just want a piece? Do I just want to be
inspired? 
To be in the presence of a force
To know that for a moment when the lights are low
and the flame burns
high 
That you are mine-to touch, to breathe in, to hold
Briefly

In a city of the lost and found
I smiled 
And you smiled back
For a time I found you
But in the pit of my stomach I have the creeping
sensation of loss
The echo chamber, the tug on the sleeve, the tap on
the shoulder
I can't hit snooze

So I will tell you about myself
I will make the fatal error of maxim exposure
I will smile and bat my eyes and 
Hope that you don't make me sorry
