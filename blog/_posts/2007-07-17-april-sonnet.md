<p>I leave you in your perfect circle<br />
you left me where I couldn't cross<br />
grateful for my piece of sunshine<br />
but knowing how much more is lost.<br />
Everyone comes up together<br />
everyone goes down alone<br />
with half a life to run away<br />
and barely time to find a home.<br />
Somehow we have made our peace<br />
dodging the forms of our skeptic souls<br />
I think tonight no one will bleed<br />
and then perhaps no one grows old.<br />
With simple words we scale a sonnet<br />
balanced, all our hopes upon it.</p>
