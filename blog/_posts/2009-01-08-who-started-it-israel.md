<p>On November 4th, here [the] record is clear: Israel broke the ceasefire by going into Gaza and killing six or seven Palestinian militants. At that point—and now I'm quoting the official Israeli website—Hamas retaliated or, in retaliation for the Israeli attack, then launched the missiles. -Norman Finkelstein, quoted JAN 8, 2009 on <a href="http://democracynow.org" title="http://democracynow.org">http://democracynow.org</a>.</p>

<p>Now, as to the reason why, the record is fairly clear as well. According to Ha'aretz, Defense Minister Barak began plans for this invasion before the ceasefire even began. In fact, according to yesterday's Ha'aretz, the plans for the invasion began in March. And the main reasons for the invasion, I think, are twofold. Number one, as Mr. Indyk I think correctly points out, to enhance what Israel calls its deterrence capacity, which in layman's language basically means Israel's capacity to terrorize the region into submission. After their defeat in July 2006 in Lebanon, they felt it important to transmit the message that Israel is still a fighting force, still capable of terrorizing those who dare defy its word.</p>
<p>And the second main reason for the attack is because Hamas was signaling that it wanted a diplomatic settlement of the conflict along the June 1967 border. That is to say, Hamas was signaling they had joined the international consensus, they had joined most of the international community, overwhelmingly the international community, in seeking a diplomatic settlement. And at that point, Israel was faced with what Israelis call a Palestinian peace offensive. And in order to defeat the peace offensive, they sought to dismantle Hamas.</p>
