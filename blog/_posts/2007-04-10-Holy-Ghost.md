<br />4:29 minutes (6.17 MB)<p>recorded to 8 tracks on my 20-bit ADAT.</p>
<p>I played this song at my cousin&#039;s wedding in Stuttgart and brought the house down.<br />
There&#039;s always something sweet about a waltz. Here&#039;s the first verse -</p>
<p><i>When all my weight is gone<br />
and I&#039;m projected here<br />
like a good idea<br />
on it&#039;s way to something real<br />
well, I&#039;m a foolish child<br />
just thick with poems<br />
about some old mistakes</i></p>
