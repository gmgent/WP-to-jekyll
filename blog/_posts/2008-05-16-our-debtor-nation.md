The government has also borrowed excess annual cash flows from the Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds and similar funds to finance other government cost. Including interest, the government owes $4 trillion to these funds, which is backed by the full faith and credit of the government, resulting in total federal debt of $9 trillion.</i><br />
