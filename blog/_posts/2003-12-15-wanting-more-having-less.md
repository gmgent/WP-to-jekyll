It's so seldom that I can put words together 
to describe this process of wanting more
and having less. If I knew
where I was going I would not
have so little fear I imagine 
days etched on frosted glass
and soft wool on flesh
cedar branches in the Fall
gravel roads and starless nights
in the city
why gravity pulls me in is 
not for me to know - this force
of implosion
I see only the spinning of the sky
and your words
like fishes in the sea
eyes that tremble
I would sit with you
as the sun melted in its own heat
and lay out the machinery on its
rusted legs
this engine of time in fragments
laid out on blankets
not for sale
free for the asking

Take this world from me
I have no need of it
it is broken anyway
