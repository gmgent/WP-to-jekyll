<p>It was all for you<br />
The long expensive road to nothing new<br />
These unappreciated lines for you<br />
Falling on this tough love crowd, it's true<br />
I did it all for you<br />
Open arms<br />
There's nothing better than those ample charms<br />
Somewhere waiting for the world to start<br />
Somehow afflicted by a broken heart<br />
Looking for those open arms</p>
<p>When I was a prince of the world<br />
All I had was a long list of words<br />
All I saw I could touch with my hands<br />
All I needed was<br />
All I needed was a chance</p>
<p>Those days are gone<br />
I think I see your yesterdays moved on<br />
They left behind that dirty smile you've got<br />
Younger than your timeless ways<br />
Your yesterdays<br />
I know all your tricks<br />
I know the way your heart can hurt like this<br />
I hate the way my plan can miss like this<br />
But there's no changing what my future is<br />
I know all your tricks</p>
<p>When I was ahead of it all<br />
And I could see what was coming along<br />
Everybody knew the way to get home, but me<br />
All I needed was<br />
All I needed was a dream</p>
