<br />3:43 minutes (4.26 MB)<p>Recorded in my early days in Los Angeles playing keys for Revolver. Medium tempo, piano-driven rock. A sweet, clever song about getting over the ex-.</p>
<p>Krister Axel - piano, vocals, electric guitar w/ slide<br />
Angel Roche Jr - drums</p>
<p>I must have been born in the wake<br />
of some misunderstanding<br />
it must have been that kind of day<br />
where no one makes a landing<br />
and zero stands for something</p>
