<p>It all feels the same
the winds of change
and summer rain
so it goes
the weight I know
this life of hope
Oh in a thousand years
Oh in a thousand years
what will change
what remains
of the summer rain
Time is all we need
to be received
to cross the sea
so we go to sleep
we rest in peace
with all we need
Oh in a thousand years
Oh in a thousand years
what will change
what remains
la la, la la la
take my hand
let's walk this path
la la, la la la
don't be scared
take my hand
In a thousand years
In a thousand years
In a thousand years
what will change
what remains
what will change
what remains
of the summer rain</p>
