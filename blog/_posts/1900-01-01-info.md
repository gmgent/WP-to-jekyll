First of all, if you are looking for music or lyrics to one my songs, click <a href="http://axelradio.com">here</a>.

This is a site full of stuff I have written <a href="/archive">over the years</a>. I have old journal posts, some citizen journalism, the occasional 'essay', and lots of code/geek stuff. I also put up song posts for <a href="/topics/rockstaralley/">my podcast</a>. For a while I was supporting two different blog sites but I finally consolidated and you can read about the drama <a href="/2009/04/and-now-we-can-talk-about-it/">here</a>. I make a living as a software engineer which you can learn about at <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/kristeraxel" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.

Have a look around and if you want you can say <a href="/contact">hello</a>.


<strong>A little more about me (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krister_Axel">from wikipedia</a>):</strong>

<blockquote>
Krister Axel, born in Paris, has been writing and performing roots and blues music for 20 years. He began his career as a songwriter performing in the streets of Paris, then New York City, Madison and finally Los Angeles. Krister Axel claims the legendary Chris Whitley as the greatest influence on his writing. His work encompasses pop songwriting as well as a roots-based approach to instrumental pieces commissioned for movie projects. His credits include pieces for the soundtracks to Hate Crime and A Colombia and licensing with NBC Networks, Regent Theaters, and many others. Most recently, Krister had a few songs placed on the season 5 dvd of Friday Night Lights (TV series) which has been very successful in generating interest about his music. These songs are Illuminate the Sky and Georgia Rain (both from the EP Swexico), as well as Something Beautiful from the album Arms Around the River.

Krister Axel has a unique style of singing, described by fans as a sort of Bill Withers meets Jamiroquai. He is a self-taught musician who started on the piano and eventually discovered the acoustic guitar.</blockquote>
