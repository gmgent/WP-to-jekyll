(goes to G at the end of the verse)
well I'm leaving in the morning
no use trying to say goodbye
all I leave behind me
is nothing more than a single tear in my eye
gonna ride that train
going where the women don't waste my time
gonna ride that train
going where the women don't waste my time
C Bb F
and I feel fine
sang my song and I drank my wine
I feel fine
yeah
and I feel fine
a little luck and the sun will shine
on me (on G also at the end)
red sky in the evening
and the moon is out over the sea
but the daylight comes
and only love is gonna set me free
I'll ride that train
leaving all my yesterdays behind
gonna ride that train
going where the women don't waste my time
and I feel fine</p>
