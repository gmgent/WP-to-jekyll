<p>What an end of the year it has been. Highs and lows. Mostly highs, I guess. :)</p>
<p>I have been married now for 6 months, and it feels great. I think I am more inspired than ever to create a smart, sustainable and above all creative life for myself along with my awesome partner Lavinia. I have been really digging in with Rails over the last few months. This brings me to my 3rd year straight of Ruby on Rails all the time.</p>
<p>After a career that was at one point exclusively contract for a number of years, I have been a full-time Director of Engineering for almost 2 consecutive years and in that time I have built a best-in-class Rails app for tracking digital pre-paid card sales that has literally changed the landscape in our class of business. Now that we are almost out of beta, it is time for me to start looking for new challenges.</p>
<p>Let&#039;s hope the next few weeks find me a great new company that is either near Santa Monica or ready to let me work from home. My life is Ruby and I won&#039;t disappoint!</p>
<p>thanks</p>
