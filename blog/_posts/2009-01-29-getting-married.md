<p>Just so y'all know, I'm getting married soon.</p>
<p>End of June actually.</p>
<p>So of course, I have a wedding album to make which will contain some new songs and some unreleased old songs. I don't have a name for it yet, but it is going to be awesome.</p>
<p>To go along with that, I have a show coming up in April again at the Santa Monica Farmer's market and then that will probably be it for a while. 5 albums in 6 years means I get to take a break. :)</p>

<p>And I could use some more comments in the Apple Store, so thanks for your support!</p>
