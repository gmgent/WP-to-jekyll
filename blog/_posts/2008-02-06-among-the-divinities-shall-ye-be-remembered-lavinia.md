<p>I thought to buy you a trinket<br />
to express the warmth in my heart for you.<br />
Some small token that might find a home<br />
next to your bed.<br />
There were toys, lawn-gnomes<br />
and rocking chairs<br />
swaying in the cold April wind.<br />
This life falls short of you<br />
in my fleeting paradise beneath the spotlight<br />
I remain incomplete. There is more<br />
to my dream than was planned<br />
I did not mean to love you<br />
without my kingdom in place<br />
I have no control.<br />
Not over this grey morning<br />
or the way the sun shines<br />
not over my heart<br />
which knows only your name<br />
I found nothing to offer you but myself<br />
and this handful of rain<br />
tears from the Kansas City sky<br />
symbols of a love<br />
eternal</p>

<p>original title:</p>
<p>&#039;Lavinia, Lavinia, Lavinia, Howsoever Beatest Thine Heart Among the Divinities Shall Ye Be Remembered, Lavinia&#039;</p>
