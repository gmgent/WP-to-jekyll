<br />4:17 minutes (3.92 MB)<p>Raw baby! This song is a gem. :)</p>
<p>Peace for the winter I pray for you<br />
that you find what you wanted to<br />
in that old yesterday<br />
you get no second chances babe<br />
you walk out in the pouring rain<br />
you get some kind of lost again<br />
I&#039;ve been waiting for you<br />
to change your mind<br />
I&#039;m learning how to turn back time<br />
I&#039;ll say good night but I don&#039;t mean mine<br />
You&#039;re a summer drug</p>
