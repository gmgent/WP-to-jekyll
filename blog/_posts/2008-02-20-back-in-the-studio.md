<p>I am almost ready to mix my new album <a href="http://axelradio.com/album/fast-train">Fast Train</a>.</p>
<p>This is my first album ever that will have been recorded entirely analog - no computers anywhere!</p>
<p>I've got three reels of 2 inch tape in my closet, and it feels positively retro. Not to mention the sound - this is the biggest sounding recording of mine, ever.</p>
<p>I've been working with a few different engineers, Mike Terry and Doug Messenger, and we've been talking about getting a new sound going for me. I like to change it up for every recording.</p>
<p>Swexico (2004) was my first recording, and it is now officially out of stock.

the previous albums:

<p><a href="http://axelradio.com/album/permanent-friday-night">Permanent Friday Night</a> (2005) has a very blues/folk slant to it, and is a real tribute to my early years here in Los Angeles. It is a long play, and really feels like a trip through my past - it's very autobiographical and honest.</p>
<p><a href="http://axelradio.com/album/arms-around-the-river">Arms Around the River</a> (2007) is quite a bit more polished than the first two, and has more of a dreamy sound to it. It is probably most akin to folk/pop records like David Gray's A New Day at Midnight.</p>
<p><a href="http://axelradio.com/album/fast-train">Fast Train</a> (2008) will achieve a middle ground between the last two records - taking off a few coats of polish and finding the organic warmth that you can only get from those old 2 inch tape machines, and featuring some of my best writing yet. It is set to be released in May but I will preview at least a track or two on my <a href="http://inmusic.org">podcast</a>.</p>
