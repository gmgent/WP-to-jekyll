ISRC codes and other kinds of meta-information contained within songs allow us to track digital clone-copies across the infinite e-verse while keeping the related information consistent. The ISRC could be considered the primary key for each song and it consist of four codes for a total of 12 digits - country XX + identifier XXX + year XX + song number XXXXX.

What this means is that for a given country, you have 3 digits to play with (the identifier) before you run out of codes. The number here is just under 50 thousand:

<pre>
      alphanumeric = 26 alphabetical characters + 10 digits (0-9).
 
      36 ^ 3 = 46,656
</pre>

I'm lucky I applied for mine early enough to get a 'US' designation, it seems that all new applications are being assigned 'QM' which is the new stand-in for US because they ran out of codes.

Crazy!

<a href="http://kristeraxel.com" title="Krister Axel" target="_blank">Krister Axel</a> and <a href="http://RockstarAlley.com" title="RockstarAlley" target="_blank">RockstarAlley</a> have the ISRC code: <strong>US Y3T</strong> and I suppose we were lucky to get it.

I get a little worried for the next generation of songwriters because some of things I had access to are going away. It's harder to get into Pandora, or listed in Wikipedia, and those are small things - but that's all there is. Small things. Now there are no more US ISRC codes. 

What is the world coming to? :)

Anyway, here are the codes for the new album. The last song is possibly subject to change because I have changed my mind a few times already. I have a confirmed mastering session in July for Gavin Lurssen to master Sky Meet Sea, so needless to say I am very excited. This will be the first time my mastering engineer has a few Grammys under his belt.
