<p>you were always out of town
i was always on the way
i could barely see the light
but you could blind me just the same
no one ever knew the truth
but you were always on my mind
all i saw was you
i was waiting for a sign
we were lovers then
we were lovers all the time
you could never stay too long
because you always had to work
but i did the best i could
and you showed me what it's worth
i never rushed a thing
i was careful just like you
you took my only heart
and kept me for your fool
we were lovers then
even if you made the rules
i could find your heart
in the pitch black dark
when the colors run
and the night has just begun
i will never stray
i won't lose my way
as long as i have you
as long as i have you
we're here with all our friends
this night will never end
now we stare across the sea
now your love is here with me
now we'll never be apart
now I know just who you are
you're the one I'd hoped to find
I was searching all the time
so let's celebrate
let's celebrate tonight</p>
