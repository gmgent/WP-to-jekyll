Yeah, I know. We learned this from an episode of SuperNanny.<br/>
It still seems relevant, and could come in handy one day pretty soon.<br/><br/>

<p>Step 1: Warning &#8211; come down to their level and make eye contact</p>
<p>Step 2: Send them to time out with an explanation of why they are going there.</p>
<p>Step 3: Walk away and stay away with no communication (1 minute per year of age of child). If they try to leave, put them back with no communication and their time starts over.</p>
<p>Step 4: Second explanation (because now they&#8217;ve calmed down and can hear it).</p>
<p>Step 5: Sorry, hugs and kisses &#8211; they can&#8217;t leave until they apologize.</p>
<p>Step 6: Move on.</p>
