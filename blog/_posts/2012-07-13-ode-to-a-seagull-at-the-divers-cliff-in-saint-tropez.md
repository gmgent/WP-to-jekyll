<em>I have to post this one too, which is also from my senior thesis.</em>

Ode to a Seagull at the Diver's Cliff in Saint Tropez

To grow wings, and push myself
through the soft pudding that is
air, in smooth slices falling away
to the left where there are mountains
set like the folds of a whale's fat belly

To dive, and glide along the shore
just above the rocks
to strike a fresh path
with every flight
and touch the earth, the way a child
first touches fire...

I have seen men jump, at night they
drag torches with them but cannot
fly the air feeds the flame
and is too thin
to hold them,

they fall like shadows
