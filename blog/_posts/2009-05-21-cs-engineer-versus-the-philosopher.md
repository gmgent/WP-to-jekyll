<p>Having once participated in a week-long workshop comprising both philosophers and computer scientists, one difference in disciplinary style quickly became evident: Faced with a description of a new application domain or problem, a typical computer scientist immediately thinks:</p>
<p>    How can I simplify this problem or abstract away from some of the details of its description, in order to make progress towards solving it?</p>
<p>    while a typical philosopher immediately thinks:</p>
<p>    What implicit assumptions have been made or distinctions overlooked in this problem description, which need to be articulated, analyzed and discussed before we start to tackle it?</p>
<p>   Needless to say, these different disciplinary styles themselves became the subject of discussion by some of the philosophers present, much to the annoyance of the computer scientists!</p>

<p>also funny:</p>
<p>    An irate dean stomps into the physics department, waving this year's budget requests.</p>
<p>    “What is it with you guys? Why can't you be more like the mathematicians? All I ever buy them are pencils, paper, and trash cans! Or the philosophers? All they need are pencils and paper!”</p>
