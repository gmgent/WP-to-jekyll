The timing of the drops
the circle flashes
all the shadows gone
when lightning passes
I'll be coming home 
with nothing in my pockets
but water from a stone
and bullets from a rocket

It's raining on your city
Raining on your city tonight

I see you on the street
before the sunrise
tapping out yor beat
preserving your size
reflections of the rain
sharp and shot with thirty 
colors from your name
wet bright and dirty

It's raining on your city
Raining on your city tonight

there's nobody on the streets
no strangers here to meet
and that's all right
Just the river and the curb
and the traffic to disturb me
in the moonlight
