I played all of the instruments except for Scotty added some drums and cajone. My wife loved this song after I assured her it was written about nothing specific.

All tied up, nowhere left to go but down 
you turn your world around 
burning down the house 
when everything goes south 
you change your state 
find a place to go away 
and try to love again 
choice is not a sin 
when someone lets you in 
I know you're hurt 
I know you're hurt 

we take what's good and we take what's right 
we break our toys and don't think twice 
we hold our breath and don't know why 
but it's over, it's over 
has it been so long since the day we were born 
because I feel so much is all but gone 
so I hold my head I don't look back 
but it's over, it's over 

it's over now, it's over now 

All tied up and something in my head won't budge 
I'm changing all my ways 
I'm counting up the days 
the ones we didn't hate 
it's over now and so we say again - you're out 
and someone else is in 
we don't know where they've been 
but choice is not a sin 

we take what's good and we take what's right 
we break our toys and don't think twice 
we hold our breath and don't know why 
but it's over, it's over 
has it been so long since the day we were born 
because I feel so much is all but gone 
so I hold my head I don't look back 
and it's over, it's over 

it's over now, it's over now 
it's over now, it's over now
