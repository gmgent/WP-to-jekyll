<p>I left my broken down in Texas
the road has never felt so long
along the way I start to wonder
who will miss me when I'm gone?
if you don't mind waiting
for the news to break
before you turn away
before you turn away
if you don't mind waiting
for the news to break
before you turn away
Some say there's nothing after dying
that all we have is in this world
I don't know much about tomorrow
but right now I feel pretty good
if you don't mind waiting
for the drugs to take
before you turn away
before you turn away
if you don't mind waiting
for the drugs to take
before you turn away
it's a life worth saving
and a chance worth taking
before you turn away
before you turn away
it's a life worth saving
and a chance worth taking
before you turn away</p>
