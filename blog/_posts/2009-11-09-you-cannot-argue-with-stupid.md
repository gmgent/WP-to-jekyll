<p>Another nugget from the terminally stupid.</p>

<p>by Michael Barone, 'Senior Political Analyst'. Ha! more like, 'Senior Political Jackass'.</p>
<p>The gist is, there was a story about how 'green' groups are disagreeing over how much to offer 'light-on-climate' ads in their public messages - i.e., do we give it to them straight or sugar coat a little so as to not scare anyone into looking the other way - not a bad consideration, in my view. So one party says, we should just 'have faith' in our public that they can handle the truth.</p>
<p>And from this, Michael Barone somehow thinks by asserting that we should 'have faith in the American public' that it equates with there being no 'concrete proof' on global warming; and furthermore by making this erroneous conclusion he has convinced himself that he has somehow categorically refuted the premise that global warming even exists.</p>
<p>Sheesh. Hey Michael Barone - maybe you should work at FOX. They love bullshitters like you. Plus, you're just dumb enough for them to hire. </p>
