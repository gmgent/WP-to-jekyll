Fast friends ex-lovers unite
and be alone together
this is no wasteland, more
sex for all and all for sex
when secrets are not hidden
they need not be kept

I have not fallen, or made
sour any glances no false
words have crept from these lips
(that once embraced 
your waist)
the memory of taste

The infinite Once, no more
no less than enough
if taste lingers well
then loss lingers too much;
one finger from a handshake
some fraction of an earthquake

Your taste, half sweet grace
a soft exquisite place
a bullet through flesh
fine feminine mesh. I
cherish the scars, tracing
your cheek among stars

And the sweep of your hip
the parade of senses - arrested
lost in the curve of your lips
losing a battle against them
the average day eclipsed
by the sugar of your skin  

The infinite Once, so perfectly
begun. Such force of attraction 
between bodies in motion
such gravity
such careless velocity
of casual emotion.

You are a sky among oceans
a belief among notions
such a deep silhouette
and delicious half-poison - 
bringing death back to life
bringing dull to explosion
