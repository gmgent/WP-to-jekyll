<p><a href="http://www.kristeraxel.com/media/2010-0910-ttf.mp3">This</a> is a great song from long ago that fell through the cracks. It may end up on an album yet but for now you may listen for free. It is one of the first songs I ever wrote about my wife from back when I still had to fight off her other suitors with my awesomeness.</p>
<p>And I really did see that sunrise in Vegas.</p>
