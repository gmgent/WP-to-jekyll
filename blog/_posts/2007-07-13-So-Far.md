<br />3:16 minutes (4.5 MB)<p>vocals by Stephanie Davis</p>
<p>recording by Babyhead (Mark Corben)<br />
drums - Angel Roche Jr<br />
keys, guitar - krister axel<br />
electric guitar - Jeramy Gritter</p>
<p>I wrote this one for Dawn Robinson when I played keys for her, but she didn&#039;t want it so I took it back. This was the demo I played her. Now I sing this one on my own and it&#039;s one of Lavinia&#039;s favorites.</p>
