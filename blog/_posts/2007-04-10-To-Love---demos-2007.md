<br />3:10 minutes (4.35 MB)<p>Krister Axel - guitar and vocals</p>
<p>A fast write, thrown together. A love ditty with a message.</p>
<p>If you&#039;re ready for me now, I&#039;d like to say a word<br />
because it&#039;s not about me<br />
it&#039;s all about you<br />
and it&#039;s out of my hands<br />
if it&#039;s out of your hands<br />
but it&#039;s never over for love<br />
you can never change love</p>
