I met Gavin Lurssen today, he seems like a nice guy. He did a great job with the mastering, that is for sure.

The cds will be ready in two weeks or so, but you can order now from <a href="http://axelradio.com/album/sky-meet-sea" title="kristeraxel on band camp">BandCamp</a> and download the album immediately while you wait for your cd to arrive.
