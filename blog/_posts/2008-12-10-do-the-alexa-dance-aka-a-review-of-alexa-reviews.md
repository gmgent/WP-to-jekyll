<p>I won&#039;t name names, or link links as it were, but ever since I discovered my own Alexa ranking(s) I have been obsessed with understanding how to optimize them - and as a matter of course I have read quite a few blogs about it. Without succumbing to the cliche of promising &#039;20 Ways to Game Your Ranking&#039;, I will share what I know.</p>
<p>The only people that matter are the users that have installed the Alexa toolbar from <a href="http://www.alexa.com/site/download">http://www.alexa.com/site/download</a>.</p>
<p>The traffic to your site of these users with the <a href="http://www.alexa.com/site/download">toolbar</a> installed over the last 3 months is what determines your rank. So at the most basic level, the logical thing to do is bump up marketing (really?) and hope that a good percentage of those new clicks are Alexa users. This may be effective, but it is also wasteful to some degree.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that the Alexa user base reputedly skews very much towards webmasters, so another good way to attract a stronger percentage of Alexa users relative to your total user base is to target content towards webmasters, like a laser. You zap in their clicks with post titles like &#039;20 Sure Fire Tips on How to Be An Alexa Jedi&#039; or &#039;I Made It Into the Alexa Top 1000 - In Only 10 Minutes!&#039;. Of course you also need to have real stuff for them to read, or else the Jedi jokes can get your Force cut off. Anyway, my angle is that I work with Ruby on Rails, I post about Ruby On Rails, and I am a webmaster - so there&#039;s your targeted audience. </p>
<p>That being said, I have started a new category (<a href="http://www.digbox.net/index.php/alexa/" title="http://www.digbox.net/index.php/alexa/">http://www.digbox.net/index.php/alexa/</a>) to track my newfound obsession. And if you are reading this and haven&#039;t already installed your very own <a href="http://www.alexa.com/site/download">toolbar</a> then you don&#039;t deserve to be reading this, and I&#039;ll probably cry myself to sleep tonight. I hope you&#039;re happy.</p>
<p>Tune in next week for more observations.</p>
