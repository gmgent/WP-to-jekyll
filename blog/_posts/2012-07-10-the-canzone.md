When I was in Poetry school, we had to write a Canzone as part of the senior curriculum. I was just reminiscing about that in my mind and I realized that it is becoming a lost form. Petrarch had a very specific rhyme scheme for a Canzone, and it seems like people are forgetting that. The internets think it is just some loose italian folk poem, or something like that, but I assure you that at least in the school of Creative Writing in Madison in the 90's it was a very hardcore format. Writing a good Petrarchan canzone is like hitting a hole in one - it doesn't happen often and it should be celebrated. One day soon I will dig up the one I wrote for my senior thesis, but for now here is the form salvaged from <a href="http://www.poetrybase.info/forms/000/31.shtml">here</a>.
