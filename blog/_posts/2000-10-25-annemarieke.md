A lot to say.

Annemarieke argued herself out of a relationship with me. The first weekend, we went to the Pier View with her dog, walked on the beach, saw dolphins. Very nice. I slept over, had unprotected sex, very much not like me. She is a good girl, and should not be any danger. The next weekend, we saw a couple of movies - Meet The Family, she liked that one. Ladies Man, eh, not so bad. At the last show she came to - Viper Room #3 - apparently she didn't like that I left her alone for 10 minutes so I could mingle. Can you say, high maintenance? Sorry babe.
So it all came down to this past Sunday. We got back from Ladies man, I needed to grab some clothes so I could sleep over and make it to work in the morning. Next thing you know, she's asking me to twist one - and then another (this coming from young Miss DARE Amsterdam). She had something to get off of her chest. She asked me directly - what do you do, in a relationship, when you know you won't get what you want? My answer, I knew why she was asking already - was, you move on. Just that simple. So maybe I decided for her.
Anyway, the next day David can't get her out of his house. She cried on her dog pillow, as I was leaving, and apparently wished that I had turned around and knocked. What a wimp. You make strong move, you can't be looking for anyone to hold your hand. I respected her for being so all business. Oh well.
And then there is Emma. She should be a chapter herself. A novel. I guess it boils down to this - anyone who offers their butt so willingly, so confidently - 9 times out of 10 I won't be worried about protection. Which is ridiculous, because that's when you are in such danger. But again, with Emma, I don't know how much she hasn't told me but I have a gut feeling that there is nothing to worry about. She said she always has a boyfriend, and I think the guys she ends up with are probably pretty wholesome types.
Shit, I don't know. That's the end of it. That won't happen again with anyone else. I promise to myself, to god, and anyone who is listening. I cannot jeopardize my future like that. It really is Russian roulette.

So, I guess I have very little to worry about. Which is good, because that is still enough to keep me a little stressed, give me that edge. I think at one point, you have to trust your instincts, and your lack of them, and as well trust your mistakes. I stand by these last two weeks, and I hope deeply that I won't live to regret them at all because they have been very dear to me. I have, all at once, all the tools I have been looking for - income, relationships, a good gig, inspiration, personal freedom. Now I need to bend the road in front of me, paint myself a doorway out. These are my strengths.
I have so much to do, and I am happy to say that I am completely on track. 26 years old, finally making a decent income, a car on the way, debts receding, social and inter-sexual skills improving, confidence returning. I am no longer afraid to admit that I deserve all of this, I have brought love into the world and I have made unselfish sacrifices. I am a good person, the universe loves me and I love it right back.
My musical tastes are rounding another corner, I guess thanks to Revolver I am embracing the Brit Pop movement. Radiohead, Travis, Coldplay - I feel these now. Another notch.

Emma girl, Emma girl

I am safe with you
I am not broken
I will live as long as I wish
I have so far to go
I have barely begun

And that is why I am absolutely content. I love where I am, what I am doing. I am looking forward to seeing my friends in Madison, and seeing my friends in Chicago.

Amen
