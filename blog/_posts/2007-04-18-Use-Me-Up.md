<br />2:32 minutes (2.32 MB)<p>recording and drum programming by Mark Corben (<i>aka</i> Babyhead).</p>
<p>Aside from having a soft spot for anything clave, I really like the lyrics here:</p>
<p>put on your favorite faith<br />
and do what want you want<br />
first one to be satisfied<br />
and the last one to drop<br />
we get lucky sometimes<br />
I&#039;ve never been so high<br />
I&#039;ve got nothing to give you<br />
but a hard heart and a soft smile</p>
