I took a ride past the edge of town
stopped the car and put my ego down
took a walk and a look around
I found what I was looking for
Everybody wants to be a star
I know that because ot's in my heart
doesn't matter who the fuck you are
we all want to make it
If it was a gift you would take it

I've been down and out and sometimes sour
but I got skills and I got power
ther's a sucker born every hour 
and I'm not like that
so it's not so bad

Survival is the only teacher
whiskey's good but love is sweeter
I'm on time when I go to meet her
and I try to bring a gift
No one wants to go unwanted
No one starts to not get started
If you've been in love you've been broken-hearted
but time keeps on picking up speed
and we learn from the ways we bleed

I've been down and out and sometimes sour
but I got skills and I got power
ther's a sucker born every hour 
and I'm not like that
so it's not so bad

I spent time in the handout line
I washed dishes for some fucked up guy
I stole bread and kisses and bottles of wine
but that don't matter to me now
because I'm alive and well somehow

I've been down and out and sometimes sour
but I got skills and I got power
ther's a sucker born every hour 
and I'm not like that
so it's not so bad
