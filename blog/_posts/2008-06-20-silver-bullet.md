<br />3:18 minutes (6.04 MB)<p>silver bullet</p>
<p>i don&#039;t need your silver bullet baby<br />
i don&#039;t want to play your midnight games<br />
don&#039;t hold me up against the fire<br />
I&#039;m not the only one<br />
who doesn&#039;t feel the same</p>
<p>if we&#039;re lost for however long it takes<br />
and somebody leads us through the night<br />
if you keep your eyes closed<br />
and believe the status quo<br />
you&#039;ll never know you didn&#039;t fight</p>
<p>i don&#039;t need your silver bullet baby</p>
