  In September I see boots before
  the first rain, vast migrant flocks
  flying before the last late sunset
  threatens: a strange, nervous pox
  which might never find a certain cure
  where the stricken fly in nervous flocks
  
  In September I can't focus, I
  am estranged, staring out
  at the passional leaves so proud
  to be falling so many
  dreams happily dying and by
  each day these old colors flushing out.
  
  Is that not the way, in September
  of all things answering to
  love? To be sudden, elegant
  and trampled like the fallen truth
  in September when time is so fast
  and every moment is the last
 
  moment of summer
