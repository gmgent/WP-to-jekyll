<p>I can't concentrate<br />
When the day yawns<br />
and through this glass door<br />
I see the outside<br />
A haze over the canyon<br />
A wet mask held in place<br />
These are just glimpses<br />
Some other system of faith<br />
Help me remember the way<br />
That I saw this cold rain<br />
As falling jewels<br />
Littering the sky<br />
And in my troubled sleep<br />
I am a witness to the morning<br />
Bright fingers around the earth<br />
The science of summer<br />
Alone in the mind's eye<br />
Balanced on crutches of fire<br />
It feeds me this bitter rum<br />
Poured over my pale body<br />
Like silver ghosts<br />
The proud new day<br />
Born without knowledge<br />
Of love or misery</p>
