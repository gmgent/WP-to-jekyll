<br />3:20 minutes (3.06 MB)<p>the light i want to shine for</p>
<p>when i was a liar<br />
when i was thief<br />
when i wore the chains<br />
of my own grief<br />
Somewhere in the distance<br />
I could see myself<br />
falling down the mountain<br />
with nothing left</p>
<p>you&#039;re the light i want to shine for<br />
you&#039;re the light i want to shine<br />
for you<br />
you&#039;re the light i want to shine<br />
for now and ever</p>
<p>the day was almost over<br />
I was not myself</p>
