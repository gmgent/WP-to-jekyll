<br />4:20 minutes (5.95 MB)<p>My only song in 5/4 measure. A song about &#039;The Secret&#039;, really, in terms of positive visualization. You are what you believe, so believe in the positive.</p>
<p>Krister Axel - Wurlitzer, acoustic guitar, vocals</p>
<p>Recorded to 8 tracks on my 20-bit ADAT.</p>
