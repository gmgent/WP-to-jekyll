Whatever

Maybe I should write another poem
Maybe I should drink some more poison
Maybe there's no difference between love and
frustration

Maybe I haven't wasted anything
It seems so sudden, this shift
This earthquake. But the sky was dark for months

And where do I find peace, now?
Which way to something better, forgiveness
I hate myself for being your victim

I still fantasize about your body but
Now I have nightmares about your friendship
About the words you never could say

If you love me, you still don't know why
And it doesn't make you happy
So why should it matter?

If I told you how many times I've said
To myself: "You aren't going to call her ever again,
unless..."
You wouldn't believe it

Unless this, or that - if you'd call by Friday
If you fucked me well, blew me whatever
Unless nothing is the logical end

I feel no more pain, I should thank you
For that but I won't
I've been numb for a month now

If I could have it all again
All the time I should have spent
Instead of wasting it on love

like I didn't have enough

I knew in San Francisco, you took your dog
And left me on the phone with Reception
"I will be alone tonight, in fact..."

I can't be let down anymore
I can't love you like this, anymore
You chose your path
I am choosing mine
I choose no more disappointment
A dusty road in August
Away from Ohio
Tell your mother you lost a friend
Somewhere in West Hollywood



Goodbye
