<p>Hey, I'm doing my first show in FOREVER at Room 5 on Feb 12th (next Friday). You should come because it's a benefit for Haiti relief and I will play at least one new song.</p>

<p>Krister Axel performs at Room 5.</p>
<p>Friday, Feb. 12</p>
<p>I don't know exactly when I'm playing because lots of people are going to be there to perform but if you want you can call them day-of-show and ask. Either that or just show up at 9pm and get a few hours of awesome.</p>
