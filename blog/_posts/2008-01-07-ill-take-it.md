<p>You all know how hard it can be to get good press, so here's a new review posted just last month:<br />

<blockquote>
I already like an album that has a song called Impeach Bush.
These songs were written around the time of the London Terrorist attack in 2005. He was there and saw how it affected the people living in and around [London].
Axel has a sort of slow, drawly vocal style. His voice is very infectious. I could listen to it all day. The songwriting is bluesy, with lots of rhythm and heartfelt lyrics. Good stuff.

It is short but sweet.</p>

UPDATE (MAR 2011) - CollectedSounds.com has since gone away - this review was from DEC 2007.
