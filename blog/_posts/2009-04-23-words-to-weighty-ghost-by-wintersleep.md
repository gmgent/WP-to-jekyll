<p>I got out of bed today<br />
swear to god I couldn&#039;t see my face<br />
I got out of bed today<br />
staring at a ghost<br />
who forgot to float away<br />
didn&#039;t have all that much to say<br />
wouldn&#039;t even tell me his own name<br />
and where&#039;d my body go<br />
oh where&#039;d my body go<br />
africa or mexico<br />
where&#039;d my body go<br />
where&#039;d my body go<br />
oh have you seen my ghost<br />
staring at the ground<br />
oh have you seen my ghost<br />
sick of them goddam clouds</p>
<p>are you some kind of medicine man<br />
get the demons out of my head<br />
you can&#039;t kill the thing that&#039;s already dead<br />
so leave my soul alone<br />
don&#039;t need no surgery<br />
take those knives away from me<br />
just want to die in my own body<br />
a ghost just needs a home</p>
