<p>This land is your land, this land is my land<br />
From California, to the New York Island<br />
From the redwood forest, to the gulf stream waters<br />
This land was made for you and me</p>
<p>As I was walking a ribbon of highway<br />
I saw above me an endless skyway<br />
I saw below me a golden valley<br />
This land was made for you and me</p>
<p>Chorus</p>
<p>I've roamed and rambled and I've followed my footsteps<br />
To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts<br />
And all around me a voice was sounding<br />
This land was made for you and me</p>
<p>Chorus</p>
<p>The sun comes shining as I was strolling<br />
The wheat fields waving and the dust clouds rolling<br />
The fog was lifting a voice come chanting<br />
This land was made for you and me</p>
<p>Chorus</p>
<p>There was a big high wall there that tried to stop me;<br />
Sign was painted, it said private property;<br />
But on the back side it didn't say nothing;<br />
That side was made for you and me.</p>
<p>Chorus</p>
<p>In the shadow of the steeple I saw my people,<br />
By the relief office I seen my people;<br />
As they stood there hungry, I stood there whistling<br />
Is this land made for you and me?</p>
<p>Chorus</p>
<p>Nobody living can ever stop me,<br />
As I go walking that freedom highway;<br />
Nobody living can ever make me turn back<br />
This land was made for you and me.</p>
