What if I am invincible… These are questions for the oracle. I am still so new to myself, I don't yet understand, yet I am so close to it. I have become larger than I know. I have outstepped my own shadow and it is some astral projection, I have stars in my fingers and love in my breath and wisdom in my voice. It matters not that I have waited what could be considered a long time. I have arrived, again for the last time before I am awake, incensed and invincible.
Where I draw my energy from is what I suppose to be the same, cobblestone streets and legs with muscles. Coffee and traffic. Love and treason. The changing of seasons. The magic of a woman who traces runes on my shoulder.
And I believe now that it is sudden and visible, like a new color to the sky. I see faces that look at me differently, I am a master. I deserve to be studied. I am exactly what I should be, unafraid and disastrous, honest and direct. Impatient. I see so clearly now, I am everywhere I need to be and I understand the future in some hidden way, some music not meant for my conscious ears. I believe and I follow and I do not need to see the way, it is before me like the attraction of gravity, of warmth on a cold night.
I have outlined my own blueprint so that it is facile, it is in vivid, immediate memory. I run these races blindly with ulterior intentions and the outcome is the same, I am above.
I bring.

I bring what you are missing, what is nowhere else and what is mine. The essence of free thought and artistic will. The message of my blood and childhood. The beauty of my own existence.
And I am your friend, whoever you are. I respond to questions and I absorb the answers, I study what is foreign to me so that it is understood - and that is why I ask so little. I have brought my own advice. I stand in my own mentorship.
Because I have not found what I wanted in any other place but myself. I shine as my own star, as my own true north and I am grateful. I was not unwise. I am at the foot of a mountain of gifts - and they will all be accepted. I will receive and nurture all arts within my being.
