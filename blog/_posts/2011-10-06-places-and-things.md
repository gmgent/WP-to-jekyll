I started out sound and ended up fearless
walked a few miles and spent a few years on
places and things, the fabric of tears I've cried
and as I found out from my own words that I used
I couldn't get high so I saw only virtues
anything works if you let it be beautiful

I never found out how to keep from falling
I never knew how to keep them calling
I'm losing you now
the way I lose everyone

innocence broken and pieces now gathered
these little wars won in bigger wars shattered
places and things are easy to speak to now
when I came back I left what had made me
I find out too late those pieces still chase me
you never do leave the first home that takes you as you are

I never found out how to keep from falling
I never knew how to keep them calling
I'm losing you know
the way I lose everyone
