<p>you said my ways
would never change
but here I wait patiently
no one knows
how far this goes
this could be like
a spider's thread
you're in my head
superstar
you're in my head
there you are
superstar
you say my name
it comes back the same
everything is as it was
for one night
we'll get it right
put those bright eyes to bed
you're in my head
superstar
you're in my head
there you are
superstar</p>
