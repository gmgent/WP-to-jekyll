<br />3:52 minutes (3.54 MB)<p>92 bpm - key of C</p>
<p>I get thirsty for your wine<br />
you get sweeter all the time<br />
I&#039;ve been through so many tears<br />
you&#039;re the one that keeps me here<br />
I want to fly across the world with you<br />
I want to be the one you&#039;re running to<br />
I want to keep holding on to you<br />
I&#039;ll be the one<br />
I&#039;ll be the one<br />
I&#039;m in love with the way you feel</p>
<p>I stayed up to watch you sleep</p>
