What I never want to say
but I say it anyway
and blame it on the traffic
There's a phrase for what went on
like a voice becomes the song
the transfer of anger

But all the things that get me by
they should be here for a while
like the California sky
like the California sky

What I have when I get home
Someone here for me alone
It puts me back on top
All I wanted was enough
Now I almost have too much
I just push out my borders

And the things that get me high
they should be here for a while
like my Hollywood at night
like the California sky

If  the Sherriff's on your trail
If you're not making the sales
Just put it on my shoulder
If you don't get to sleep at night
If your dress won't fit you right
Just put your tears on my shoulder
