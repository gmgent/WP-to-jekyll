Added vocals by Lindsey Harper.

When I walked through the door 
with the wine in my hands 
and a smile on my face 
like a child 
the weekend would fade 
but then something would change 
and we'd be here 
together again 

I waited up 
I shined the light 
I found the truth 
and I made it right 

there's a place I believe 
where the sky meets the sea 
where we both can be free to hold on 
and this place I can see 
where we both need to be 
is where the sky meets the sea and holds on 
so baby hold on to me 
where the sky meets the sea 

this show must go on 
because there's nothing so strong 
as the force 
of a billion desires 
we lose everyone 
to the bass and the drums 
and the voices 
that just feed the fire 

I waited up 
I shined the light 
I found the truth 
and I made it right 

there's a place I believe 
where the sky meets the sea 
where we both can be free to hold on 
and this place I can see 
where we both need to be 
is where the sky meets the sea and holds on 
so baby hold on to me 
where the sky meets the sea 

when I walk through the door 
with a hand in my hand 
and a kiss from the girl 
that I love 
we never look back 
at the broken down tracks 
and the troubles 
that we overcome 

there's a place I believe 
where the sky meets the sea 
where we both can be free to hold on 
so baby hold on 
hold on 
hold on 
hold on to me 
where the sky meets the sea
