raining in chicago

she came from the ocean
rising up with faith unseen
she came like a river
flowing straight to me
I was only faking
baby you could change my mind
you were so not ready
to bring these dreams to life

baby don't you know that 
I was ready to die for you
now you're out there running
down that road again

it's raining in chicago
but baby you could change my mind
looking ror tomorrow
you drive all over town

baby don't you know that 
life is bigger than you sometimes
you're still out there dancing
all night by yourself

baby there's no reason
for you to be alone
to ever lose yourself
letting it all slip away

you're still out there dancing
all night by yourself
