Well, things are wrapping up for me this month - I am basically done moving all of my blog posts onto the <a href="http://blog.kristeraxel.com">new site</a>, and my plan to finally get away from the horrible service of <strong>Dreamhost</strong> is almost done. <strong>TheAxelVault.com</strong> was a Drupal site that I built almost 3 years ago, and I am sort of sad to see it go.

My wife always loved the look of it, and I did too. The problem was that it didn't run very well on Dreamhost, despite my paying for a 'private' server - they really use the term loosely. And it was largely something that had seen its time come and go. I don't really know what is going on with <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a> these days - but I am now using <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a> which seems to fit my needs much better.

I had a lot of hits on that web site for a while from 2008 through 2010, but then I moved my music onto <a href="http://axelradio.com">BandCamp</a> and TheAxelVault lost its purpose. Soon enough it will only be a screenshot.

Let us take a moment to honor this relic from my past.
