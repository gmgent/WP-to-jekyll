One more day and one more war
pennies wasted love endured
one more chance to stand up
you're a seed in my mind
or the way I see the downside
it's a blessing
a blessing in diguise
  
in my lap with nothing on
checking out pictures of movie stars
you don't have to say it
it's the curse of the wise
to not love anything twice
we've got a blessing
a blessing in diguise
