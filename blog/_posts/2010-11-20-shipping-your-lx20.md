<p>If you are shipping your XT, LX-20 or XT-20, put it in this "shipping mode." It will secure the transport for safer shipping:</p>
<p>WITH NO TAPE in the deck, power up the machine while holding down the "record ready/arm" buttons for tracks 1 and 7.<br />
Display will read "0 SHiP *".<br />
Press "play" and you will hear the transport engaging as if there was a tape in it. Give it a few seconds to complete.<br />
Display will read "SHiP rdY". (Ship Ready)<br />
Power down the deck. When it is powered up again, the transport will reset to normal mode. Allow a few seconds for this to complete before inserting a tape.</p>
