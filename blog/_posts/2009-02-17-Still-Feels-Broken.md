<p>lyrics:</p>
<p>still feels broken to me</p>
<p>all the laws have changed
you think you know but you won't stay the same
you think you feel but you don't feel the way
the night is fixing to fall
and it's on the road for you
know the signs but you won't see the truth
all these clouds are hanging over you
but you can't run from yourself
oh well
you can't run from yourself
you can't change what you feel
you don't choose what you need
still feels broken to me
now I know the names
of all these things that I once thought were strange
and all I'm looking for is a better way
to be the one that I was
I was tired before
but now I see that it's an open door
and all this time I never went too far
i didn't know where I was
oh well
you can't run from yourself
I was young and afraid
now I'm old and ashamed
oh well
you can't run from yourself
you can't change what you feel
you don't choose what you need
still feels broken to me
when I don't believe at all
in the words you are saying
you can't run from yourself
you just choose where to look
try to do what is good
try to be understood</p>
