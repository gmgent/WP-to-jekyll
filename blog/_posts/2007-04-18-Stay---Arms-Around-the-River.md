<br />4:23 minutes (6.03 MB)<p>Adam Marcello - drums<br />
Brandon Krueger - bass, guitar<br />
Krister Axel - piano, Wurlitzer, vocals</p>
<p>from the album Arms Around the River (2007)</p>
<p>Stay, if you want to stay<br />
take what you want to take<br />
love who you want to love<br />
break what you&#039;re tired of<br />
but don&#039;t worry<br />
that the world wants to self-destruct<br />
don&#039;t worry<br />
just stay until you&#039;ve had enough<br />
don&#039;t leave before you&#039;ve had enough</p>
