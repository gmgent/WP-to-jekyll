<p>Here&#8217;s what I wanted to mention &#8211; this <strong>Brave New World</strong>, I hope to use this category as something akin to my &#8216;morning pages&#8217;. Of course, for me, they are &#8216;night pages&#8217;. Let me explain.</p>
<p>I was having lunch nearby as I often do, and I usually bring a book or something to read &#8211; I use my phone as a backup, but it&#8217;s never the same. Books are still very useful to me. I have not yet tried Kindle. So there I was, and I sort of on a whim and without much thought brought a copy of &#8216;The Artists Way&#8217;, which someone gave to me a long time ago and I have never been able to get through much of it. I sit down at the bar, put my book next to me, and the bartender immediately says &#8211; &#8216;Great book! I read it and totally loved it.&#8217;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m trying to nod, and I can&#8217;t think of anything to say, and it becomes a bit of an awkward moment.</p>
<p>As is often the case, I am overcome with thoughts and I disengage from reality to some degree. By the time I come to, I have ordered lunch and a beer, and the guy is no longer talking to me. There had been two simultaneous thoughts running through my mind.</p>
<p>1 &#8211; Wow, that totally feels like an insult to me because I feel strongly that I am already a card-carrying &#8216;artist&#8217;, whatever that means, which suggests that I am already going the &#8216;Artists Way&#8217; and screw you for not knowing that;</p>
<p>2 &#8211; Wow, that guy is really reaching out to me and if I should probably acknowledge that in some meaningful way, his whole thing feels vaguely 12-step, there is something really touching about this, how did he experience the book exactly?</p>
<p>It was a real eye-opener for me. I almost felt called out as someone who is still searching for something, and even if I was what&#8217;s wrong with that? But ultimately, I was insulted in some way, and then I was surprised by how insulted I was, and then the inevitable guilt made me feel that I might be turning into a slightly more negative person than I used to be. All in the space of a minute or so, which made for one self-reflective burger.</p>
<p>Anyway, I did get through a bit of a chapter, which basically talked about what the author calls morning pages, which means everyone on the &#8216;Artists Way&#8217; should take the time to write every morning. I immediately thought of myself in college, where all through my dorm year and a few years after that I would force myself to write poetry at night, before I slept. I have a few thousand pages of that stuff. I understood the same concept way before this woman even wrote the book, so it felt vaguely self-affirming. The only problem is that I haven&#8217;t done that in years.</p>
<p>But every day is a new day in the brave new world.</p>
