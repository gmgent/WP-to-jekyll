<p>I wrote this for a job interview that never panned out. Tune in next week for the matching User class (linked <a href="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/2008/12/polymorphic-user-list-class-part-ii/">here</a>).<br />
Question: why do interviewers often admit to not being very technical, yet continue on to ask complicated questions and become bewildered as a consequence? </p>
<p>And furthermore, how good is the guy they hire if no one knows how to talk to him? Ah well, it is almost Christmas.</p>
