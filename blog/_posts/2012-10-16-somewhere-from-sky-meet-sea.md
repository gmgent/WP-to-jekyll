<a href="http://kristeraxel.com/media/2012-kristeraxel-Somewhere.mp3">This</a> (Somewhere) was also recorded at the Village Studios in Santa Monica. Love that place. Horn part written by the amazing Bill Dowling. Somewhere - a very simple song that I think was produced beautifully (if I do say so myself).

You don't want to be 
alone in a storm with me 
you don't want to be 
lost at sea with me 

you might love me 
you might care 
you might need me 
somewhere 

you don't want to be 
chasing stars with me 
you don't want to be 
hiding your heart from me 

you might love me 
you might care 
you might need me 
somewhere 

somewhere, somewhere 
you might need me somewhere
