<br />3:07 minutes (3.57 MB)<p>from the debut recording by Krister Axel, Swexico. Acoustic, folky, finger-picking melancholic ballad about regret and forgiveness.</p>
<p>Wasn’t it fast, my sweet?<br />
We lost what we couldn’t keep…<br />
When did it all become<br />
Like a loaded gun?<br />
Out in the rain you live<br />
Chasing another year<br />
If you believe in me<br />
Say it out loud</p>
<p>You’re not going to waste it all<br />
Turning around without</p>
