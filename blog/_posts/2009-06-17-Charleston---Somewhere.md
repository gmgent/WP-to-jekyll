<p>when i get to Charleston baby
i'll find myself a star
when i get to Charleston baby
i'll be waiting for the night to fall
ooh, ooh
when i get to Charleston baby
i'll be waiting for the night to fall
when i get to Charleston baby
i won't know where to stay
i might have time to drink some bourbon
or i might have to run away
ooh
where's that whiskey bar
ooh
Charleston tell me where you are
i've been saved before
i can't take much more
when i get to Charleston baby
the first thing I'm gonna do
is write you a letter baby
that says I'm coming back to you
ooh
I won't be here for long
ooh
I'll be waiting for the night to fall
ooh
I won't be here for long
ooh
I'll be lying in my baby's arms</p>
