i swore we would burn before we could fade
and we lived like kings as long as is fair
i saw a one way ticket on a seat by your name
the one thing sure is I was never the same

found a princess bride on a west coast train
and we fell in love like we knew the way
and she fills my mind
she lifts my weight
I live for her
every single day
