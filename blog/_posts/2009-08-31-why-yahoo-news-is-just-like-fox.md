title: why Yahoo news is just like FOX

<p>Yahoo is quickly becoming the same slobbery propaganda-spewing hate-maw that Fox is. Here's how you know. Of course, this story was 'provided' by the New York Times, which some say is a 'liberal' source - but admittedly, only on 'cosmopolitan' issues like gay marriage, as opposed to 'hard' news like fiscal or domestic policy where most people don't pay attention but the ones that do mostly accuse The Gray Lady of actually being conservative.</p>
<p>Here is the untenable nugget of right-wing silliness:</p>
<p><i><br />
If the president's proposals are all adopted, the figure that year will be 20.7 percent, with increases from 2009 for every group — those with the lowest incomes as well as those with the highest. How can that be, given that the president has promised to raise taxes only on those who make at least $250,000 a year?</i></p>
<p>Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, points to two reasons. First, Mr. Obama does not want to continue some special tax breaks, like a tax credit for new homeowners, that were part of the stimulus package he pushed through Congress. More important, the 2012 estimates assume a better economy, in which incomes will be higher and more people will therefore be in higher tax brackets.</p>
<p>Mr. Williams argues that, eventually, President Obama's vow not to raise taxes on the middle class is going to have to be violated. “There is just not enough money” earned by the very, very rich, Mr. Williams said.<br />
</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>There is <b>'just not enough money earned by the very, very rich?'</b>.</p>
<p>What planet are you on, Floyd?</p>

<p>Here's a highlight for you:<br />
<i><br />
The richest one percent of U.S. households now owns 34.3 percent of the nation's private wealth, more than the combined wealth of the bottom 90 percent. The top one percent also owns 36.9 percent of all corporate stock.</i></p>
<p>You don't have to raise taxes on the middle class.</p>
<p>You just don't. The top 10% is all you need.</p>
