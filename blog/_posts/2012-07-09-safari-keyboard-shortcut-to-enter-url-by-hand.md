My old version of Safari used to default focus in the url bar when you open a new window. Now it defaults to google search which is super annoying. I am always entering urls by hand and very seldom run google searches compared to how often I am just trying to visit a page I already know about.

I can't find a fix for that, but there is good shortcut to put focus in the url bar where it belongs.

Open-Apple (Command) + L. The same shortcut works in Firefox.
