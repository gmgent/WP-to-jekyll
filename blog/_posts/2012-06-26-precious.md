I had a dream and you were looking
at a sun whose color changed
you were love and love was precious
your precious lips were wet like rain

Iâ€™m living in a train to heaven
moving fast with miles to go
I want to be a stroke of lightning
so I come through the clouds alone
I come through the clouds

and all i can see
is all that you are
and all i can feel
is you in my heart

we turned to wolves and ran like tigers
we jumped the fence and headed home
I want to be a stroke of lightning
I'll light up the sky for you
I'll light up the sky

with everything changed and everything the same
