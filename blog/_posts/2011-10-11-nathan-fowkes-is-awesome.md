I have a very specific image that I am looking for as the cover for <a href="http://skymeetsea.com" target="_blank">Sky Meet Sea</a> and I was hoping my sister could do it but she is too busy being a full-time mother. I started looking around for someone else to execute my vision and I stumbled onto the site for <a href="http://nathanfowkes-sketch.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Nathan Fowkes</a> who I think is absolutely amazing. I have asked him to help and I am hoping he says yes! His eye for color is truly stunning and because the image I want is a sunset with a lot of complex and subtle hues I know he could knock it out of the park.

I have had great luck with all of the wonderful people that have done cover art for me in the past, so let's hope my lucky streak continues. In any case, if you are not aware of <a href="http://nathanfowkes-sketch.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Nathan's work</a>, you should be. Spend 5 minutes looking at his blog and you will wish you were a graphic artist.
