I finally got an iPhone. I wouldn't dream of developing a Rails app on anything but a Mac, and I had an iPhone 3G a while back, but for the last 2 years I had a Droid phone that synced pretty well with my google account and only froze up the tiniest little bit every now and then. Now that I am actively drawing down my gmail account and moving back to a personal (aka private) email account, it made sense to move back to the iPhone and try out the awesome new camera. It is slightly annoying that you can't use the photo stream on your Mac until you upgrade to Lion (note to anyone like me that was excited for iCloud and the photo stream) and there is literally no way out of the box to get pictures off of your phone without it except by emailing them to yourself, one by one. But the good news is that there are a couple of apps that you can buy that will do that for you.

I am using <strong>PhotoSync</strong> to push pictures to my desktop, <strong>PhotoLoader</strong> to push pictures to Facebook, and <strong>Move2Plus</strong> to copy the facebook folders over to google plus. Good times.

Here is a short list of the few game titles I am enjoying:

<ul>
<li>Scrabble</li>


<blockquote>This is a classic. I wish the music wasn't so horrible but so far it seems to be a pretty solid app. The UI is pretty slick and functional and it's easy to turn down the horrible music. There is also a stats section which is a nice touch and is something I wish Civ Rev had.</blockquote>

<li>Civ Rev</li>

<blockquote>This is easily my favorite title for PS3 (as Civilization Revolutions) so I was pretty happy to see it offered for iOS. A Halloween special at 99 cents, how do you say no to that? It is almost the exact same game, down to the technology tree and all of the different Wonders. The one issue I have in terms of gameplay is with the screen real estate, I wish it were easier to scroll around the map without inadvertently moving your soldiers around. It would be great if you could lock a solder to the city and not have to worry about it. I lost a city that way because I moved my army out by mistake and Napoleon just marched his ass right in there. I took it back the next round but not before he stole <em>literacy</em> from me. That was a dark day. I'll bet this title is great on an iPad because you would have so much room. The one thing that is missing that I loved from the PS3 version is keeping track of all your victories. I enjoyed systematically getting every victory under Warlord before moving on to Prince, for example, and you can't easily track that for iOS.

<li>Carcassone</li>

<blockquote>
This is a weird one, but it gets under your skin. It takes a while to figure out what a good strategy is, but it is also sort of intuitive and once you get a taste of victory it is easy to become obsessed. It is a lot like chess in the sense that you need to think about all sorts of eventualities. If <strong>Scrabble</strong> is unappealing to the barely literate then <strong>Carcassone</strong> will be unpopular among those who do not premeditate or who think <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_philosophy" target="_blank">systems philosophy</a> is boring.</blockquote>
</ul>

In the end, I do not do a lot of gaming on my phone but if I did these titles would keep me busy for a little while. Feel free to post any personal favorites in the comment section.
