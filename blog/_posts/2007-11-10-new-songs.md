<p>...are on the way. I was just in the studio again at <a href="http://newmonkeystudio.com" target="_blank">New Monkey</a> (which is where I recorded Arms Around the River) and we took a good crack at laying down the basic tracks. I think this album is going to blow everything else out of the water. Of course, I say that every time I make an album. Anyway, check out <a href="http://axelradio.com/track/les-yeux-gris">Les Yeux Gris</a> for a little taste. See you in the Spring!</p>
