Almost midnight and I don't know
where I am or where I should go
City nights like a pale young face
staring out into empty space
What do we do to pass the time
watch TV with a glass of wine
who would want to have to drive
who would want to be sober tonight
There is a flock outside the door
stramgers vying for seats on the curb
Let your words fall like rain comes down
I will listen but I won't drown
speak to me like you say your name
without thinking and and without pain
speak to me like you say your name

Do you love me like fiction stands
without fact and without demands
when the world weighs on your knee
will you still make some room for me
Hollywood just outside yor window
Just one dollar to dream in limbo
Let your words fall like rain comes down
I will listen but I won't drown
speak to me like you say your name
without thinking and and without pain
speak to me like you say your name
