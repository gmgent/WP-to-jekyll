<p>This is very serious.</p>
<p>It's not like this didn't just happen to us about 9 years ago; or basically every 2 years since.</p>
<p>Of course, the alleged fraud is on a scale even bigger than we we are subjected to in the US - so far - but the premise is the same:</p>
<p>Subvert the will of the people, ostensibly 'for their own good' and don't take no for an answer. Shoot if necessary. And make the lie really big.</p>
<p>Fascism has grown up for the 21st century and it is a bitch.</p>
