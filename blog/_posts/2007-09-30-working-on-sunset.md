<p>I work on Sunset now<br />
where dreams die and take shape<br />
where highways are twisted at the throat<br />
of the green that once was<br />
sometimes with more choice<br />
comes less freedom<br />
more sugar in place of food<br />
sirens for a handshake<br />
bright lights casting longer shadows<br />
soon the earth will erupt<br />
and reshape the landscapes<br />
in her likeness<br />
to invade the invaders<br />
with mountains for fingers<br />
she brushes the cities<br />
from her brow. As if<br />
to invent a simple fabric<br />
between God and Man<br />
she turns over<br />
her bed</p>
