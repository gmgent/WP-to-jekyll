We are moving back to West Hollywood so Lavinia can walk to work. I will also be brushing up on some calculus courses at <a href="http://www.smc.edu/apps/pub.asp?Q=10226&B=1">SMC</a> so I can finally get the <a href="http://www.amath.washington.edu/studies/ms/">graduate degree in Applied Math</a> that I've had my eye on for so long. We found a really unique space with a nice yard for Mooshoo and we still have a Trader Joe's around the corner. See you later, Hollywood!
