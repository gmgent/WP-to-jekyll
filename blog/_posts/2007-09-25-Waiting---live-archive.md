Krister Axel - electric guitar, vocals
<p>Pulled from an ancient cassette circa 1998.<br />
Written/recorded in Madison, WI 1995-1998.<br />
Mediocre audio quality, but very telling of this period in my life as a songwriter. Recorded live at the now defunct Cafe Assisi.</p>
<p>I was once a coffee cup<br />
morning came and filled me up<br />
if this is an empty place<br />
bring me around to face the day</p>
