<p>Rain on Me</p>
<p>when i was old enough to dance<br />
when i was high enough to see<br />
anywhere the sky is dark<br />
it rains on me</p>
<p>and i race<br />
just to fall<br />
just to be where you are</p>
<p>all we are is all we are<br />
what we learn is what we teach<br />
anywhere the sky is dark<br />
it rains on me</p>
<p>and i race<br />
just to fall</p>
