<br />4:34 minutes (6.27 MB)<p>One of many songs written for Lavinia. A love song.</p>
<p>Recorded to 8 tracks on my 20-bit ADAT.<br />
Krister Axel - Wurlitzer, acoustic guitar, vocals</p>
<p>When I was 25 I tried to drink the sky all up<br />
I knew enough to know that I was getting older<br />
and change was going to come soon<br />
soon so soon so soon<br />
now it&#039;s been so long<br />
since we both went off and started something<br />
I know enough to know</p>
