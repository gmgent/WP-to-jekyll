This is the world ugly
sullen but not without sunshine
when I remember the seasons
they are like shadows. In the name
of progress my days are bleak soldiers
This is shallow love,  surfaced
cold and wet. If we build
from this a pleasant shelter no
doubt will I drown.

Drown in emptiness, blank
oxygen thats feeds nothing
loud and open, unheard emotion
words perfectly wrong 
moments of clear blindness
gone numb. To meet love
with love is the effort of a lifetime,
a goal with no end. I cannot
smile in compensation
or laugh despite sour words. I
have wandered into this
I must not wander out.
All actions will be deliberate,
Let no one say I fell into
this grave. Let them
see that I dug it first.
