<p>I got burned by not being able to answer the question -&#039;what are closures?" with much of anything. It was pretty embarrassing, seeing as I use them all day. :)</p>
<p>I had a decent enough explanation about passing code blocks around, but what I forgot to mention was the &#039;yield&#039; keyword (which is a bit like talking about soup and forgetting to mention that you have to add water).</p>
<p>Also, I started trying to write up an example (like I have seen Brian Guthrie do so many times) and couldn&#039;t come up with a good one fast enough. </p>
<p>Anyway, I am decidedly a pragmatist and I don&#039;t get as academic as some of my more CS-based brethren, but I decided then to starting boning up on good examples of what closure is so I can do myself justice next time someone asks me that question.</p>
<p>so I found this (by some dude named Paul):</p>
