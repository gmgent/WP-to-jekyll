<p>This is funny:</p>
<p>On Friday, former <span class="yshortcuts" id="lw_1249932567_5">Gov. Sarah Palin</span> raised more than a few eyebrows with a <a href="http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/ynews/pl_ynews/storytext/ynews_pl857/33000084/SIG=11nitu5im/*http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=113851103434" target="_blank"><span class="yshortcuts" id="lw_1249932567_6">Facebook</span></a> post on Obama's "evil" vision for health care. In it, she claims that the administration's bill includes "death panels" that would decide who receives health care:</p>
<p></p><p style="padding:0 20px 1em; font-style:italic;">The America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with <span class="yshortcuts" id="lw_1249932567_7">Down Syndrome</span> will have to stand in front of Obama&rsquo;s &ldquo;death panel&rdquo; so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their &ldquo;level of productivity in society,&rdquo; whether they are worthy of health care. Such a system is downright evil.</p>
<p>
Appearing on ABC's "This Week," <span class="yshortcuts" id="lw_1249932567_8">Newt Gingrich</span> <a href="http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/ynews/pl_ynews/storytext/ynews_pl857/33000084/SIG=12kqeu8gu/*http://blogs.abcnews.com/george/2009/08/gingrich-defends-palins-death-panels-.html" target="_blank"><span class="yshortcuts" id="lw_1249932567_9">defended</span></a> Palin's attack on "death panels," even after <span class="yshortcuts" id="lw_1249932567_10">host George Stephanopoulos</span> helpfully pointed out that the bill doesn't actually include any kind of provision for "death panels."</p>
