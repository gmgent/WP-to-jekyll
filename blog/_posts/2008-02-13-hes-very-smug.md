Just for the record, I'm not really  against Obama, I just thought we could do better. I do recognize how monumental a black president would be for this country, but it just reminds me of how excited we were in 2006 about the Democratic sweep in Congress - and look where that got us.
<p>Anyway, I just hope this is more than another chance to go through the motions. I want to believe. Sure, I'd like a Dennis Kucinich, or a Ralph Nader, but I suppose I'll settle for a Barack and just try to look at the bright side.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, I think the nicest thing I can say about Barack is that he's no G.W. Bush - and that, my friends, ain't nothin - I guess that's a good place to start. That, and if he really means what he says, then we may get our <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15358236/page/2/">habeus corpus</a> back, and I think there are a good number of additional issues that would we see eye to eye on. So I'm cautiously optimistic.
