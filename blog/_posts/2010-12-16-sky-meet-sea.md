<br />4:33 minutes (4.17 MB)<p>work in progress.</p>
<p>When I walked through the door
with the wine in my hands
and a smile on my face
like a child
the weekend would fade
but then something would change
and we'd be here
together again
I waited up
I shined the light
I found the truth
and I made it right
there's a place
I believe
where the sky meets the sea
where we both can be free
to hold on
and this place
I can see
where we both need to be
is where the sky meets the sea
and holds on
so baby hold on to me
where the sky meets the sea
And the show must go on
because there's nothing so strong
as the force of
a billion desires
we lose everyone
to the bass and the drums
and the voices
that just feed the fire
I waited up
I shined the light
I found the truth
and I made it right
there's a place
I believe
where the sky meets the sea
where we both can be free
to hold on
and this place
I can see
where we both need to be
is where the sky meets the sea
and holds on
so baby hold on to me
where the sky meets the sea
Em D/F# G6 Asus
where the sky meets the sea
when I walk through the door
with a hand in my hand
and a kiss from the girl
that I love
so we never look back
at the broken down tracks
and the troubles that we overcome</p>
