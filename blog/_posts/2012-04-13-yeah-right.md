<blockquote>According to an Orlando Sentinel story later confirmed by Sanford police, Zimmerman told authorities that after he briefly lost track of Martin, the teen approached him. After the two exchange words, Zimmerman said, he reached for his cell phone, and then Martin punched him in the nose. Zimmerman said Martin pinned him to the ground and began slamming his head into the sidewalk.</blockquote>

Because any 17-year-old would want to put down the skittles, after having lost his pursuer, and re-engage the fat scary 28-year-old who had been chasing him by somehow pinning the much larger aggressor to the ground and slamming his head into the pavement. That makes about as much sense as the idea that if you were getting your head slammed into the pavement you would be somehow all better by the time you show up at the police station.
