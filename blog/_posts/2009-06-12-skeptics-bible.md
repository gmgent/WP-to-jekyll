<p>Very cool stuff. I love technology! This is one of my favorites:</p>
<p>God is rightly filled with remorse for having killed his creatures. He makes a deal with the animals, promising never to drown them all again. He even puts the rainbow in the sky so that whenever he sees it, it will remind him of his promise so that he won't be tempted to do it again. (Every time God sees the rainbow he says to himself: "Oh, yeah.... That's right. I promised not to drown the animals again. I guess I'll have to find something else to do.")</p>
<p>from Genesis 9: <a href="http://www.skepticsannotatedbible.com/gen/9.html#9" title="http://www.skepticsannotatedbible.com/gen/9.html#9">http://www.skepticsannotatedbible.com/gen/9.html#9</a></p>
<p>The mind of God is a terrifying thing - warmonger indeed.</p>
<p>or this:</p>
<p>Lot and his daughters camp out in a cave for a while. The daughters get their "just and righteous" father drunk, and have sexual intercourse with him, and each conceives and bears a son (wouldn't you know it!). Just another wholesome family values Bible story. </p>

<p>So why does the right take it's cues on sexual morality from a book that extols incest? Someone please answer that for me.</p>
