<p>I had a dream and you were looking
at a sun whose color had changed
you were love and love was precious
your precious lips were wet like rain
I'm thinking of a train to Georgia
moving fast and speeding up
I want to be a stroke of lightning
but I'll come down
when there is no one out
and there's no one around
we turned to wolves and ran like tigers
we jumped the fence and headed home
I want to be a stroke of lightning
but I'll come through
the clouds alone
when there's no one around</p>
