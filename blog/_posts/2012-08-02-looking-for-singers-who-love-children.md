I have to say, this is a very interesting and original request. I have an old work acquaintance who contacted me and is putting on a show <em>a la</em> Jackson 5. He is a jazz lover and a detail-oriented person, which is why I think this is worth asking around. Apparently he had two singers already lined up but they didn't show up to practice and just pulled out of the project. The last I heard from him, we met up for a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charnett_Moffett">Charnett Moffett</a> show at the Catalina club, and now he is essentially MDing a show for his children and some family friends. They have been practicing for this show since May and need some vocalists to round out their sound.

He is willing to pay $250 per head, which includes the performance and 2-3 practices. He needs one male and one female singer.

If you are interested <a href="http://blog.kristeraxel.com/contact/">contact me</a> immediately and I will put you in touch with Michael.

Details:

<blockquote>We have  a band with my two sons, Miles (17), Max (5), and friends: Nikole (8),  Caren (21+), Roy (21+), Eric (21+).
Max will be playing Drums, Guitar, and Violin.  Nikole will be singing on three songs (soloing on Lotus Flower). 

The show is primarily an opportunity for my sons to play together, Miles lives in Japan most of the year so they haven't 
had an opportunity to play together before.   Miles has been playing guitar, bass, and piano for about four years. Max
has been playing drums & percussion & violin for about three years and guitar for about two years.

As most of them are instrumentalists, it would be good to have vocalists so the music is much more interesting.

We would have two rehearsals on Sunday August 5th, Sunday August 12, both at 3:00p.m. in Pasadena.
And one rehearsal on Saturday August 18th at 11:00 am (most likely, still TBD).


The website for the August 19th performance is here:

The working title of the  band is:  "Vanguard"
We're only expecting one show at this time.
