<blockquote>
This was copied from my book - in 1991 which was my first year in college. It can be seen as a sort of poetic exercise. I was at the time (and still am) enamored of E.E. Cummings and his creative use of punctuation, as well as his style of bending grammatical rules at his will. At this point, I was not yet even a committed Poetry major. Imagine 4 books full with poems like this written in the first 2 years of college, and you can see how I finally came to understand myself through poetry. I forced myself to write a poem every night before bed, whatever the circumstances.

If I am arrogant so be it
I'm too poor for presents
But I'll make it worth your while


A thousand faces are mirrored
Here, in an absent type
Of company
A tethered slave, is fighting
Now, for his right
To be free.
Their eyes are cold,
And pitiful
As they watch for some important
Shame, they treat life as a 
Mystery, and not -
As they should -
Like a game.
Hypnosis.
All is one, I
Being, I
Am within that one
Which makes that one
Me.
All these faces
Are laughing - they are
Mine. Or
Parts (of me)
At themselves.
The Gaping Mouth will eat you
Now - is better than
Waiting (I hate having to
Wait. That your neck is
Exposed - not your mix
Of breed (we just like
Would probably just cut it off
At the jugular
To suck like crabs legs
And suck
Or any other armored sea food.
I like it when
Kcrk, khrck
They crunch. It's all in
The preparation / like a good
Crouton.
A mixed, tossed, lively little
Salad of souls with your 
Choice of greek
