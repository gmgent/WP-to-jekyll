<p>Aww, isn't Twitter cute?</p>
<p>So far, I have noticed:<br />
MusicMonday, as in -<br />
#musicmonday this song rocks! </p>
<p>and FollowFriday, as in -<br />
#followfriday @myfriend has the mad links, yo!</p>
<p>It reminds me a bit of what would happen if we were all still in kindergarten, which then reminds me of those NYU kids who held up their own cafeteria last Fall - you know, what happens when no one is in charge, except everyone is. Which means trending topics (twopics) are subject to the lemming law, which is to say that in an echo chamber you can't count votes and think they are unique.</p>
<p>The lemming law meaning: in the Twitterverse, anyone and everyone is happy to follow anyone else off a cliff. The cliff of deliberate propaganda, or the cliff of general collective foolishness, or the cliff of faux outrage.</p>
<p>So what's next? troubledtuesday, where everyone vents their woes...<br />
#troubledtuesday ah, the angst of it all!</p>
<p>or even Wacky Wednesday?<br />
#wackywed I'm too sexy for my keyboard...</p>
<p>Don't get me started on the weekends.</p>
