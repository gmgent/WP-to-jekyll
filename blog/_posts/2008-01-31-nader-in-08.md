<p>With the only two remaining Democrats leaning middle-right and middle-righter, I like the sound of a Nader candidacy. I heard him on the radio, and he used two bad-ass scrabble words in the same sentence - pernicious and profligate. Sweet. Take that, Georgie. I swear, it will be the beginning of a new age when we finally have smart people making the decisions again. Good on ya, Ralph.</p>
