These chains could never hold me
I'll find a flame in the dark
we stand together against this
unseen hand
unseen hand
these chains are made of honey
sweet talk and a bee's nest of lies
I see the signs from heaven
that say I'm right
I know I'm right

the road is long
the river is wide
the mountain is stone
and cold is the night
the road is long
the water is high
my will is strong
and the strong will survive
how cold is the night
