<p><i>As measured using DSC, the material ignites and reacts vigorously at a temperature of approximately 430 °C, with a rather narrow exotherm, matching fairly closely an independent observation on a known super-thermite sample.</i></p>
<p>continued:</p>
<p><i>The low temperature of ignition and the presence of iron oxide grains less than 120 nm show that the material is not conventional  thermite (which ignites at temperatures above 900 °C) but very likely a form of super-thermite.</i> quoted from:</p>

<p>It is commonly known that the fires in the towers never burned hot enough or long enough to melt the steel frames within them, much less 'pulverize' the steel and allow the towers to fall at a speed within 10% of a 'free-fall'. The simplest explanation, which also fits very well with what the public saw in the news videos, is that the towers were brought down by demolition. This fits with numerous testimonies to the effect of hearing either 'numerous explosions' or 'a crackling sound' just prior the fall.</p>
<p>Now, finally, a study of dust from the site has shown the undeniable and significant presence of 'super-thermite' in all of the samples taken. So, the movement for 911 Truth can now also say that it has stronger data to support the 'controlled demolition' theory than there is to support the 'magically hot and infinitely burning jet fuel' theory. You know, seeing as we had all that evidence just sitting right there, one wonders why Rudy Giuliani recycled the 'crime-scene' steel immediately.</p>

The Martha Mitchell Effect</strong></p>
<p>The Martha Mitchell effect is a process by which a belief is mistakenly diagnosed as a delusion by a psychiatrist. This is named after Martha Beall Mitchell (the wife of John Mitchell, the Attorney-General in the Nixon administration) who alleged that illegal activity was taking place in the White House. At the time her claims were thought to be signs of mental illness, and only after the Watergate scandal broke was she proved right (and hence sane).</p>
