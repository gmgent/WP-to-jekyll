A bittersweet poem. Hand percussion and piano with acoustic guitar. Very open and spacious. Mid to low tempo. From the album <em>Permanent Friday Night</em>.
<p>Krister Axel - piano, guitar. vocals<br />
Billy Hawn - percussion</p>
<p>You look good up there<br />
With the lights on your face<br />
I saw someone thatâ€™s<br />
Better than this place<br />
I sing your praises<br />
From the rooftops baby</p>
