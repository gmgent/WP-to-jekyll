<a href="http://kristeraxel.com/media/vault/KILLER.mp3">link</a>

<br />4:24 minutes (4.04 MB)<p>Pulled from an ancient cassette circa 1998.<br />
Written/recorded in Madison, WI 1995-1998.<br />
Mediocre audio quality, but very telling of this period in my life as a songwriter.</p>
<p>Krister Axel - acoustic-electric guitar, vocals<br />
Carl Remde - bass, vocals<br />
Jon Vriesacker - electric violin<br />
Robert Schoville - drums<br />
Galen Karriker - banjo<br />
Matt Rappaport - percussion</p>
<p>That was a hell of a band.</p>
