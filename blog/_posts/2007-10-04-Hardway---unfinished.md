<br />2:23 minutes (2.19 MB)<p>she took the hard way<br />
headed for the city on the sidewalk<br />
just trying to be brave<br />
she had never seen a live one<br />
burning with the taste<br />
of a brighter day<br />
As she walked<br />
through the rivers of her thoughts<br />
she was holding on to love<br />
she kept her eyes up<br />
walking like a soldier through the desert<br />
in the desert</p>
<p>you&#039;ll never take me<br />
you&#039;ll never break me<br />
you&#039;ll never take my heart</p>
