<br />3:05 minutes (2.82 MB)<p>there will come a day for you when<br />
nothing makes sense<br />
there will come a day for you when<br />
all you got is you and boy<br />
there will come a day in sunshine<br />
when all you need is wine<br />
there will come a day in time</p>
<p>oh, you&#039;ll see what you&#039;ve done<br />
see what you&#039;ve done</p>
<p>there will come a day for you when<br />
the sun is gone<br />
there will come a day for you<br />
with nothing left to lose</p>
