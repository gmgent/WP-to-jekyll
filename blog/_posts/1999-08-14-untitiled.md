<blockquote><small>This is the poem that started a downward spiral in the relationship I brought to LA with me in 1999. We arrived in the Spring and by August we were just at each other's throats.

We were sharing a computer at the time, and my GF found this poem and emailed it to me at work with the headline: <strong>what's up with this</strong>?
</small></blockquote>



I should not
listen so well
or remember the emotion
at the expense of detail. I
had been told such wonderful things
about my perfect illusion that
I also thought it was no different.
My strengths are beginning to
become weaknesses,
liabilites. Unplanned explanations
And I have nowhere to turn
except inward. Again
retreat, apology again
selfish martyrdom
again aggressive surrender.
I have such pride
in small things and large
feelings, giant
shadows and short friendships
vast oceans of recycled bitterness
and I spit all day red reasons,
blood-red spirit
that never flies. I asked for
everything here
I dreamed of the hope
that would greet me like a mother
greets a newborn and I
found traces
Nothing more. So if I
speak painfully and if
my truth doesn't fit you
If you cannot understand my words
then read your book. And
the insult is your creation
because honesty should never be
qualified. I
apologize for my soul
and love is embittered, I break
my stride and love falls
I follow your whim
and love is trivialized. So
we can make a new pact and
you can ponder petty victory
because my need is greater,
and because you have a woman's army
but you have lost the
unretrieveable. My heart
no longer burns with your image.
It grows cold
