<p>I will not write about American Idol. This post will not be about Adam Lambert or Paula Abdul or whatever.</p>
<p>I say this because I have never watched it. Never, not once. Some of you may gasp. It is easy for me to say this, because there is no 'television' in my apartment, per se, although I do get my Hulu on occasionally.</p>
<p>Anyway, the reason I'm talking about American Idol is simple - it is because yesterday, one of top the top 10 trending 'twopics' on Twitter was '#SaveEarl', which came about because whichever network (NBC?) carries My Name is Earl decided to drop it, and noooo, the Twitterverse can't have that. So we had thousands of voices yesterday waxing victimized about it; it was quite a sight. Whereupon, I decided to write </p>
<p>#saveearl screw Earl save Aung San <a href="http://www.burmacampaign.org.uk/mtvaction.html" title="http://www.burmacampaign.org.uk/mtvaction.html">http://www.burmacampaign.org.uk/mtvaction.html</a> #burma #SuuKyi</p>
<p>and I didn't get a lot of love.</p>
<p>My point was that if this much otherwise unused energy can be harnessed so easily to 'Save Earl', as they say, maybe someone somewhere can appreciate the devilish irony that this kind of activity is always necessarily irrelevant. If it were to involve something meaningful like putting real political pressure on our own government to weigh in more heavily on the Aung San Suu Kyi issue, then 99% of our sedated community would gloss over and start looking for America Idol - which itself is not news.</p>
<p>I think the story of our generation is now beginning to be "How the hell can we break our addiction to oil?", and that is a good thing. I think it should also be "How the hell can we break our addiction to television?", because I guarantee they go hand in hand. I will even go one further - we've heard a lot of talk about this lack of morality on Wall street; we as taxpayers were deliberately sodomized repeatedly, after which we were told that it was for our own good. This pattern continues.</p>
<p>I've also heard that daydreaming actually allows the subconscious brain to resolve inner issues of morality and deep emotional connection building, relative to the recent past, as if when left alone the subconscious starts making sense out of disparate 'stuff' from that day.</p>
<p>We also know that brain activity levels are at their lowest when someone is watching TV; the subconscious is not free at that point to do anything, it is functionally shackled.</p>
<p>So my final point is this - we will not fix Wall Street, nor will we harness the populist power of the middle and working classes, until everyone gets rid of their television and starts daydreaming.</p>
<p>A lot.</p>
<p>There's flies in the kitchen<br />
I can hear them a-buzzin'<br />
and I ain't done nothing<br />
since I woke up today<br />
how can a person<br />
go to work in the morning<br />
come home in the evening<br />
and have nothing to say?</p>
