I write.

Something leads me where there are always surprises.

Last night I felt the earth move at 4am and I was writing. Even Los Angeles is lonely in the morning and it felt good, like exploring the unknown. I awake to find myself not very far from beauty, and I am proud. Joseph Arthur, no better than me. My songs are becoming small miracles.
And tonight, by the stars, I made Stephanie want me. She sang for me. :)
I am here, I have connections, next weekend in Vegas with Jenni. It is my world, in all it's contradiction. I am what I should be. Ryan wants to hear my music now. They are starting to come to me.
And this smoking… this blessed curse.
It is who I was, and who I am walking away from. My blues will follow me wherever I go. This speaking to no one, it is all I can do now. My voice is made, it is what it is. I write.
And I remember Jon talking about my use of metaphor. I appreciate what exists but forget what I create.. it is new, it is poetry. Follows birds across the ocean… I have arrived.
Look at me, with my arms around the world.
