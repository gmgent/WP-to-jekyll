I have been hard at work on finishing <a href="http://skymeetsea.com" target="_blank">Sky Meet Sea</a> so I haven't played out in a while but this Sunday I will be playing a short set at <a href="http://www.facebook.com/room5" target="_blank">Room 5</a>.

Come on out if you are around, I'm on at 8:15p and it's a great lineup all night.

I'll be playing songs from the upcoming album.
