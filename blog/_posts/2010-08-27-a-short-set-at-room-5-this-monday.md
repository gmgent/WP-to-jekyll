<p>I'm finally playing a live set for the first time in a long time. I have some new songs I want to try out.</p>
<p>I'll be at Room 5 on Monday sharing a bill with some great friends of mine. Mike Freas and Trevor Menear are going to tear it up in the 8:00 hour. around 9 or 9:30 I'll play a few songs and then, Joel Eckels, Chris Pierce, Gaby Moreno and Paulie Cerra are in the round to finish up.</p>
