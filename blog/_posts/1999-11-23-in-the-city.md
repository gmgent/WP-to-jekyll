If there's a future in my hands
some navigation to be planned
over this strange and simple nest by the ocean
Bodies stacked above the earth
we are a nation giving birth
to the first machine alive in the city
May the sun still rise for us all in the city

Every day begin the same
Let the rage step out of place
in this strange and simple space by the ocean
If I am deaf then save your breath
If I am blind don't waste your time
These illusions are my pride in the city
May the sun still rise for us all in the city

stolen cars and ego boosting
Real good news but more confusion
Bank of America my favorite parody
they suck so bad they must need some charity

When the minutes turn to years
and the war chiefs come to peace
I won't be lying face down in the city
May the sun still rise for us all in the city
