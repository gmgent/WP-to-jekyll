>     maybe that will make me happy
>     to know that no one ever thinks badly of me

> and always smile at people and to always seem happy, at least
> 
> but there were always people she hadn't met

> and it only made her feel worse
> so she said to herself:
>     Maybe if I keep moving around, I will find the perfect place
>     and everything will be right
>     and I will know where it is that I was meant to stay
> 
> so she travelled, and spent lots of money
> she saw Rome and Cairo and Bangkok and Rio
> and everywhere in between
> and she had fun, she stayed busy
> but one day, she woke up in a hotel
> and felt something was missing
> there was an emptiness about her
> and she realized that she missed her home
> but she didn't know where that was anymore

> So she said to herself:
>     Maybe if I don't listen to anyone
>     and always do what I want without thinking
>     and be completely selfish
>     maybe that will make me happy
> 
> so she never thought about anyone
> and always pushed her way to the front of the line
> and took the best seats
> and double-parked, and never shared with anyone
> but she realized she was lonely, and that wasn't working either.
> 
> So, she was finally in very much despair
> she had tried everything
> and still wasn't happy
> so she asked her friend emma what to do
> 
> and emma said - I know just the thing
> you should have sex with my friend krister
> he'll cheer you right up
> 
> so that's what she did
> and she never stopped smiling
