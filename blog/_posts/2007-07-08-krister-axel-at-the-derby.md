<p>I love the Derby. It is old and rustic like a rundown barn in the middle of a freeway except the roof is built like a bee nest and the shadows fall wherever they can.<br /><br />
We came and went like an afternoon tempest except we left a few cds behind and I kissed someone on the cheek. Ordering a drink from that bar somehow reminds me of leaning up against the Formosa cafe dressed the 50's detective and lighting a match off my shoe. Champagne, and coffee for the horses.<br /><br />
Let us all become lost for a short time together, and awaken to the future that invades us.<br /><br /></p>
