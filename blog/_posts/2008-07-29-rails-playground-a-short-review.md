<p>This will be quick. I just had to put in a few words about Rails Playground.</p>
<p>A little background: I have been hosting my sites with Joyent up until now, and this last week I was just having some serious mongrel problems, and it started not being fun. I started looking for alternatives, and I found Rails Playground (RP) and it has a pretty cool angle.</p>
<p>Joyent is ok, but their whole thing is that they are empowering you to do everything yourself. They are just giving you a sandbox, basically, which is great unless you start having problems that you don&#039;t know how to fix yourself. Then you have to wait for their relatively slow customer service.</p>
<p>RP, on the other hand, will give you unlimited, much faster service for comparable rates and they will set a lot of it up for you. I gave them my svn info, paid the bill, and they set me up with capistrano, added the capistano files to my svn account, set up the proxy, and configured mod_rails to run with passenger.<br />
Done!</p>
<p>I have never had a deployment go so easily.</p>
<p>Anyway that&#039;s my 2 cents.</p>

<p>Disclosure: I am not benefiting from this review at all. I asked them for a deal and they turned me down!</p>
