<p>Somewhere in this chaos lives good fortune<br />
Perched beside a campfire<br />
Breathing in the stars<br />
Without numbers<br />
I feel these forces move through me<br />
A lover's rage and a lonesome hunger<br />
My true north and my blessings<br />
Contented for now<br />
And the flow of these images<br />
Spirals of patience and love<br />
As I drag my possessions behind me<br />
Scraps of mortar and blood</p>
<p>I build myself a landscape<br />
In the image of your grace<br />
Asleep in the arms of innocence<br />
A dream plays across your face</p>
<p>When the smoke has lifted<br />
And the sun never again forgets to shine<br />
Let us both remember such places<br />
A thoughtful summer not quite wasted<br />
Waiting for the lights to change<br />
For one color to bleed into another<br />
For the fuel to catch the flame<br />
May nothing remain the same<br />
Not quite yesterday<br />
And never tomorrow<br />
This nest of sorrows past<br />
Of heaven misplaced</p>
<p>Asleep in the arms of desire<br />
A dream plays across your face</p>
