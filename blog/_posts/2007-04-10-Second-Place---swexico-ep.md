<br />4:16 minutes (4.89 MB)<p>Not everyone believes that they are beautiful.<br />
A dirty lap steel, strong middle tempo Southwestern style. Almost cowboy-ish.</p>
<p>krister axel - electric guitar, vocals, wurlitzer, B3<br />
Adam Marcello - drums<br />
Carson Cohen - drums</p>
<p>You suffered on the wheel<br />
You donâ€™t know how you feel about this living<br />
All the signs are there<br />
The good news and the bad conversation</p>
