<p>I am doing a lot of things right now. Life is awesome. A new job, a few album projects in the works, and the summer en route. We are just moving right along.</p>
<p>I am also approaching my 1 year anniversary and I just have to say that I love my beautiful wife a little more each day.</p>
<p>I would like to wish good fortune and good health upon everyone in the world.</p>
