<p>I have posted previously about Hilary and Barack, so it's only fair to say something about John McCain.<br /><br />
Of course, there's not a whole lot to say, except that he would make the same kind of jackass president that George is. Sadly, that fact is barely enough to make the news, what with all the hollerin' and carryings-on over in the Finance sector, except we're not even hearing much of a story about that these days. So I guess that just means those good, honest people in the media must just have their hands full of free shwag, fruit baskets and cashier's checks. Anyway, here's a good read from my favorite blog site <a href="http://smirkingchimp.com/thread/13838">Smirking Chimp</a>.<br />

Following in the footsteps of George W. "Double Dip Recession" Bush comes John "McSame" McCain, who admits in public that economics isn't his strong suit, but nevertheless, he tells The Wall Street Journal that his solution for the economic trough we're entering is to make the Bush tax cuts permanent and cut corporate tax rates.</i><br /> <a href="http://smirkingchimp.com/thread/13838">read more</a><br />

ps - the heart, gist, and catch-phrase from this post was lifted secretly from the political writings of one <a href="http://smirkingchimp.com/author/brian_morton">Brian Morton</a> - which is probably a pseudonym (and if it isn't, it should be).<br /></p>
