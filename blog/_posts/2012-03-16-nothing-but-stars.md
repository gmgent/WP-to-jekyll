take what you want from me now
and tell me what you want to be now
but watch what you say
you might get everything
you turn to the passing day now
you're throwing it all away now
you're keeping the wolves at bay
by throwing it all away
ah
we aim for the truth
and we fall
we fall

hey hey
we came from nothing but stars

I  know what you want to say there
how did we get that way there
I'll never go back
to the wars that we've had
ah
we aim for the truth
we aim for the truth

hey hey
we came from nothing but stars
