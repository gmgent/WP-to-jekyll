<p>let me take your sadness
and tie it to a stone
at the bottom of the ocean
where no one ever goes
baby I won't leave you
unless you want me to
you're talking yourself crazy
just like you always do
I won't let you fall apart
I won't let you fall apart
I won't let you fall apart
in neverland
on your feet, love
in neverland
get on your feet again
baby take my number
you might need a friend
with all these strange voices
and someone pulling strings
I won't let you fall</p>
