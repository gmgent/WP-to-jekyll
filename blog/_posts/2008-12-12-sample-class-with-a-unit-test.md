<p>Also from a job interview a while back.</p>
<p>Here is the class that they gave me, which I extended -</p>

<p>And the unit test I wrote for it -</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/860922.js?file=test_ypset.rb"></script>
<p>Good times!</p>

UPDATE: There is a small issue with the original class, so it does not work out of the box. There is a problem with the partition method, so feel free to fork and fix it.
