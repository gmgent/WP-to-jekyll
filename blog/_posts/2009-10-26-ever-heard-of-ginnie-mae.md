<p> Banks have been silent partners in the meteoric rise of the Federal Housing Administration.</p>
<p>In the past year, the nation's financial institutions have snapped up securities backed by Ginnie Mae, a government-owned agency that guarantees payments on mortgages backed by the FHA. That helped drive demand for Ginnie securities and created an outlet for billions of dollars of FHA-backed loans made to borrowers who in many cases couldn't afford big down payments.</p>
<p>As of June 30, the roughly 8,500 federally insured banks and thrifts were holding $113.5 billion of Ginnie securities, compared with just $41 billion a year earlier...</p>

<p>plus few notes from the blogosphere:</p>
<p>"The irony is that banks that are reluctant to lend and are trying to unload their own mortgage holdings are at the same time helping to prop up the housing market by buying up securities backed by mortgages."</p>
<p>That's not the half of it. Banks are also USING the FHA programs as a way to unload their mortgage holdings, by refinancing mortgages on their books into FHA or agency programs.</p>
<p>The banks could very well be buying back mortgages from the same borrowers who were on their books, except this time wrapped with full faith and credit protection from the government.</p>
<p>The whole mortgage finance industry in this country is a scam.</p>
<p>____</p>
<p>More unintended consequences of well-meaning but misguided regulations.</p>
<p>Risk-based capital rules classify government-guaranteed mortgages as "risk-free," so banks don't have to hold any capital against such assets. This means that banks can lever up on these mortgages, earning assets that require no capital back-up.</p>
<p>In so doing, banks provide an outlet for GNMA to sell off the "new subprime" garbage being underwritten by FHA, just at CDOs were used to sell off the "old subprime" garbage underwritten by Countrywide and Washington Mutual.</p>
<p>Without securitization, we wouldn't have had the subprime bubble that started this crisis. Without securitization, FHA couldn't continue the madness.</p>
<p>These are incredibly risky mortgages.</p>
<p>The risk is all being borne by the U.S. taxpayer.</p>
<p>___</p>
<p>and:</p>
<p>This was NOT unintended. They FHA know exactly what they were doing.(with blessings all around) And don't be surprised if we see even a further expansion of the FHA underwriting guidelines to ensnare an ever bigger amount of dead loans sitting on bank balance sheets.</p>
<p>These banks full well know that the easy FHA guidelines represent the best exit strategy for their troubled loans on thier balance sheet. And while the last bonafide resi securitizations were May '07, since then, banks have accumulated their share of resi loans on their balance sheet that they'd gladly jettison off to FHA land.</p>
<p>And there are those special servicers too that are trying to convert their loans to FHA. Remember, don't be surprised if FHA eligible dollar amounts start creeping up higher....</p>
<p>Short of just giving these banks money, (they are finding this more difficult these days) the alchemists of economics sitting in DC are out of bullets. They are out of ideas. They are soon to be flirting with a $$ that could start to question their open checkbook, and quantifiable and unquantifiable healthcare deficits.</p>
<p>Expect FHA guidelines to easy, elibible dollar amounts to rise. All politically sellable, and quite intentional.</p>
