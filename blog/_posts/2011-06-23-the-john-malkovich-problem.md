<blockquote>Talking to Kramer and Underkoffler, you really get a sense of just how much thought was put into this system. For example, Underkoffler brings up the “John Malkovitch [sic] problem” (referring to the film Being John Malkovitch which has a scene in which everyone in the world is John Malkovitch). You don't want to capture a part of the screen being presented and end up re-presenting a piece of the presentation. Again, all of these kinds of things had to be solved on the backend and UI levels. Underkoffler says they've solved almost everything, but there's still work to do perfecting this future of computing.</blockquote>

I love weird tech vernacular. Too bad TechCrunch can't spell Malkovich correctly.
