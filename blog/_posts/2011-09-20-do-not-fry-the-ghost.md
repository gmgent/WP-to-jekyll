A fascinating discussion from Facebook. I heard about these peppers on Man vs. Food. Crazy. Also, I heard something from my wife about a guy she works with that did permanent damage to his stomach by eating these things.

<blockquote>I have Ghost peppers growing in the garden. I looked them up on Wiki. Apparently in their native India, they are used to make hand grenades for crowd control. They also use them to make smoke bombs. And they smear them on fences to keep rouge [sic] elephants away. I've never grown weapons before. I'll don Kevlar and goggles come harvest time.</blockquote>


<blockquote>Pepper heat is measured in "Schoeville Units" [sic]. Tabasco sauce is approx 2,000-2,500 a habenero is around 20,000. A young, green Ghost is 600,000+, and a ripe red one is well over a million and a half. They're almost poison.</blockquote>

<strong>the punch line:</strong>

<blockquote>
This is 100% true. My son Aidan came back with some ghost chillis from a farmer's market. We didn't know how to cook them so we decided to fry them. Wrong move! All we did was turn the oil into an aerosole [sic] and essentially tear gassed our house. The pan we used had to be thrown out! The worst part, was no matter how much I washed my hands the traces of the oil was still on there and I had to take my contacts out. It was like I was pepper spraying my own eyes. One of the all time stupidest things I have ever done.</blockquote>
