I started out sound and ended up fearless
walked a few miles and spent a few years on
places and things and whatever else that made me
find what I need but lose what I wanted the most

and as I found out from my own words I used 
couldn't get high so I saw only virtues
anything works if you let it be beautiful
find what I need but lose what I wanted the most

innocence broken and pieces now gathered
little wars won in bigger wars shattered
places and things are easy to speak to
find what I need but lose what I wanted the most

when I came back I left what had made me
find out too late those pieces still chase me
you never do leave the first home that took you
find what you need and lose what you wanted the most
