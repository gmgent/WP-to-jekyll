<p>Dreamhost is also pretty crappy, if you need Ruby on Rails support. Why does everyone advertise RoR and then not support it?</p>
<p>It looks like a decent Hostmonster style host, with a snazzy interface, but at the end of it here were the problems:</p>
<p>Terrible SVN support; let me say that again - SVN kind of sucks already, but I ended up with a bunch of 500 errors, and I don&#039;t need anyone to help SVN suck more than it already does.</p>
<p>SOME good wiki stuff, but it was out of date, was NOT supported (see above), so I got frustratingly 80% close to a real capistrano deploy and then could not finish because were server compatibility issues (an old Ruby version) and without direct shell access I was fecocked. Then my SVN got corrupted. Fun!</p>
<p>With Dreamhost, if you aren&#039;t paying for a hosting service, you can&#039;t even manage your domain forwarding.</p>
<p>So I am still on the lookout for a good Ruby host and I am not any closer.</p>
<p>As a recap - DREAMHOST is the worst Ruby on Rails hosting service EVER! They are, of course, right there next to Joyent, who also has a large home in Crapistan.</p>
