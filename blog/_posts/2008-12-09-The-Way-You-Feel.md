<br />3:47 minutes (5.19 MB)<p>the way you feel</p>
<p>I&#039;ve been thirsty for your wine<br />
you get sweeter all the time<br />
I&#039;ve been through so many tears<br />
you&#039;re the one that keeps me here</p>
<p>I want to fly across the world with you<br />
I want to be the one you&#039;re running to<br />
I want to keep holding on to you<br />
I&#039;ll be the one<br />
I&#039;ll be the one</p>
<p>I&#039;m in love with the way you smile<br />
I&#039;m in love with the way you cry</p>
