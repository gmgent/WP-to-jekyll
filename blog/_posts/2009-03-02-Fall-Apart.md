<br />1:43 minutes (1.57 MB)<p>let me take your sadness
and tie it to a stone
at the bottom of the ocean
where no one ever goes
you know I won't leave you
unless you want me to
you're talking yourself crazy
just like you always do
I won't let you fall
I won't let you fall
I won't let you fall apart
or fade away
let's burn together brightly
so talk about your favorite
talk about your worst
talk about your fears
and all the things that hurt
you know I won't leave you
unless you think I should
you're talking yourself crazy
just like you knew you would
I won't let you fall
I won't let you fall
I won't let you fall apart
or fade away
or lose you heart
or be afraid
let's burn together brightly</p>
