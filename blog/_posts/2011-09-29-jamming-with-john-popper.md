This is a great lesson in why one must google oneself every now and again. I do this somewhere between every month and every quarter - both to verify my own SEO efforts but also to eavesdrop on anyone who is posting stuff on the internets about me. Sometimes, you find new things that you don't expect. Like that one time I found a whole album of live shots from a <a href="http://axel.me/3r" target="_blank">Hotel Cafe show</a> that I forget even existed.

Today, at the top of page 27 of my google search for 'Krister Axel review', I found this.

Yup, that is a really great shot of me jamming with the one and only John Popper. This was taken at South by Southwest in Austin, Texas around March of 2006. I was performing a set at the <a href="http://www.one2onebar.com/" target="_blank">One-2-One bar</a> (love that place) and in the middle of <a href="http://axelradio.com/track/southern-girl" target="_blank">Southern Girl</a>, John Popper hears the music through the window, likes it, walks in, someone hands him a microphone and he jams along. The timing was priceless. He took my solo for me. :)

So as it turns out, my friends over at One-2-One must have taken the picture, and are using it as one of their <a href="http://www.reverbnation.com/page_object/page_object_photos/venue_89531" target="_blank">profile photos with ReverbNation</a>. Thankfully someone put my name in the caption and google found it. Awesome.
