<p>My first network licensing deal comes through on NBC. <br />Anyone who orders the first season DVD of <a href="http://www.nbc.com/The_Black_Donnellys/" target="_blank">The Black Donnellys</a> will hear my song <b>Something Beautiful</b> on an episode somewhere. Further details are elusive, but you can pick it up and see for yourself.</p>
<p>And yes, I got paid.</p>
<p>Many thanks to Rescue Records and my personal hero TerriLynn. </p>
<p>w00t!<br />
