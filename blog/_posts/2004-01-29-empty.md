Sometimes I'm empty
and I'm waiting for the sound of a friendly voice
sometimes I think I know better
that true passion lives alone
I make motions in the desert
I assemble my defense
like a brittle mountain
as the earth begins to shake

I am at war now
with the cold tyrants of mediocrity
I see that I've fallen
where my instincts led and left me
I am shaking in the desert
I assemble my beliefs
These little soldiers
marching through the heat

My sweetest friend
your heart is always pure
I imagine life through your eyes
and I wish that I could give more
I only have one chance
to build some blessed destiny
with these words of mine
this voice and these dreams

I am unraveled
the walls of my heart are scoured clean
I feel the seasons
raw and hungry for completion
the world is patient
I am frantic in my lust
for a perfect diamond
some piece of god that I can touch
