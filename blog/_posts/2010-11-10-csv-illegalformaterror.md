<p><code><br />
  CSV::IllegalFormatError<br />
</code></p>
<p>If you all of a sudden are getting this error in your tests and you just upgraded your version of Rails. say to 2.3.5 or above, never fear.</p>
<p>You just have to change all of your old csv test fixtures to yaml.</p>
<p>Have fun with that!</p>
