carry the water from the east to the west
give us a penny and then lock up the rest
the rich get richer and the poor don't matter
we don't have the power
we don't have the power

carry the water from the river to the plain
give us a penny and then take it away
the rich get richer and the poor don't matter
they just carry the water
carry the water
