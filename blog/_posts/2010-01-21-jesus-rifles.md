<p>quoted:</p>
<p>The maker of the sights, Trijicon, has a $660 million multi-year contract to provide up to 800,000 sights to the Marine Corps, and additional contracts to provide sights to the U.S. Army. </p>
<p>John 8:12, referred to on the gun sights as JN8:12, reads, "Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life."</p>
<p>Trijicon confirmed to ABCNews.com that it adds the biblical codes to the sights sold to the U.S. military.</p>
