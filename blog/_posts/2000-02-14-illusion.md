I feel the hard line of decision
The fangs of necessity at throat
And your majesty of illusion which
Makes me bow. If fragility is a crime
It is yours, exquisitely - if 
Passion is your dream then let us
Walk together, sleeping and
Growing not old. Too much 
is a word from your lips, and sometimes
Too little. There are reasons for
No reason and lies painting truth about
Ecstasy remembered and loveless projection
And where are you, where am I when
Time inches past and pain is only dull;
When money like water puddles in the sun
And the heat is a rough hand pushing?
I am next to your skin with my teeth
Beneath the flower of your pride
With my palms at your weak side
At arms to your defense. 

Be it for you that I am invisible
Be it your name that holds thick pleasure
For this soldier at peace.
Be it unspoken the conversation,
And unwritten the pact that
Brings my food to your table and 
your fingers to my cheek, your words
to my canvas and if I regret
again, as I did being lost, it will be that
I wasn't lost with you
Sooner. Because this is a shadow fallen,
We are a wooden floor together, uncracked

There is nothing else
