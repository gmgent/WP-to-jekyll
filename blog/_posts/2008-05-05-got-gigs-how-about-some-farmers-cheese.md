<p>These days, I do stealth gigs. You never see it coming, it feels more natural that way. You know, you just make some phone calls a few days out and cross your fingers.<br /><br />
After all these years, I just never really got the response from handing out flyers a few months in advance that I was looking for. It is a very Los Angeles thing to do, handing out little pocket flyers to everyone in the club on the weekends literally 8-10 weeks in advance of your show, the idea being that said flyer sort of ends up on a fridge or a coffee-table somewhere, sending out ripples of free viral advertising. I don't buy it. I think that rather, what happens is people resent the intrusion subconsciously, and have a number of weeks to feel increasingly guilty about the fact that they (somewhat irrationally) resent the idea of committing themselves to a course of action so far in advance. This mental process continues logically to the point where even if they are free, they don't want to go out as much because they at some point classified the event as a non-option. That's my 2 cents worth of amateur psychoanalysis.<br /><br />
So, if you are missing the Axel and want to hear some good music, please click below to view the details. There is no pre-committal. You can decide to go or not go on your own schedule. Because at the end of the day, I've got my own vehicle for free viral advertising - it's called a website.</p>
