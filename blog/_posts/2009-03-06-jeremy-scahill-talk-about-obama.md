<p>You can look at the direction of US policy like this: We have a president now who said he'll use preemptive military action inside of the borders of another country without informing the leadership of that country, if he deems it's in the interests of the US, as in the case of Pakistan; a president who's just delivered what, for all practical purposes, sounded like the victory speech of the previous president for his war based on lies and illegal acts of aggression, and who is surging, beyond the wildest hopes of the Republicans, in Afghanistan, putting more troops than almost any other politician was calling for, and is going to get the US further just sunk into the hole of a very violent and bloody war of occupation in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>This is, once again, an imperial presidency, and I think it's cause for great, great concern. And unfortunately, the spines of many people that actually have the ear of Obama seem to have been surgically removed now that he is president.</p>
