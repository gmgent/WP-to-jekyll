<p>Somewhere there is a voice that<br />
Tires quickly, and retreats.<br />
Leaps quietly over<br />
Ambushes and dead-end streets, so </p>
<p>Drawn to the distant that none can approach<br />
This voice. So fearlessly building<br />
A new world from nothing,<br />
This whisper of a song.</p>
<p>And these cycles reinvent themselves,<br />
Like children lying to each otherâ€¦<br />
Maybe I imagined this voice<br />
That cannot speak.</p>
<p>I love that you are from Brooklyn, I<br />
Would say to her. I had already found<br />
Poetry in you, like<br />
A current of gold</p>
