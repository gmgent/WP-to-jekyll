## Jekyll Base ##
This is a base that will get you started with jekyll create by Daniel McGraw (@danielmcgraw).


## ADDED by Krister Axel ##
I have added to the base from Daniel considerably. - Krister Axel (@kristeraxel)

I pulled in two generators in the _plugins directory, both not written by me but updated slightly (credits were left in the comments where available). I also added the search.json and rss.xml files. The search.json file is used to power the dynamic search that I have written, used in the /Search page via a search.js file in /scripts.

### Usage ###
From the original Jekyll base - Check out my [post series](http://danielmcgraw.com/2011/04/14/The-Ultimate-Guide-To-Getting-Started-With-Jekyll-Part-1/) on how to use Jekyll Base to create your own Jekyll powered blog.

I am working on a new deployment scenario and hosting solution, once that happens I will write a post about it and link here. For now, this project is not ready to launch so don't clone it just yet. I have a lot of personal files still in here.

Once I am done I will release this as a blog base project, with wordpress-style 'pages', category and archive pages that are generated automatically and best of all a javascript- and json-based search that took me quite a while to get right.

## launch ##
Ok I am pushing this into the world, visit the main readme [here](https://github.com/gmgent/WP-to-jekyll).
