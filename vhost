remove below this line and edit to your liking; save as etc/httpd/conf.d/vhost.conf. 
notes:
If you donâ€™t have a file named vhost.conf, you should go ahead and create it. Make sure your file permissions are right (644).

I am also doing a subdomain push, so that the subdomain (u.inmusic.org) will go to the /var/www/other/ folder, while the root will still pass through to /var/www/html (the default).

I'm doing this to publish many domains on the same little EC2 slice. It is a total time-saver.
